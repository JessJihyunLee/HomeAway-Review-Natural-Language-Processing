The two TV rooms were very convenient. However, the bedrooms are very small and there are only two in-suite bathrooms out of 7 bedrooms. In addition, the bathrooms do not have an air conditioner vent, nor do they have a humidity vent. It was miserable. The bathrooms never cooled off. Also the half bath only had boiling hot water in the faucet. No cold water available, so we could not use it.

Except for the large master downstairs, most of the bedrooms had only a regular bed. If you and your husband haven't slept on a regular bed in a long while, it can be a very difficult adjustment.

1,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p169977#reviews,"Jun 10, 2010",5/5,Lazy Crazy Fun,"Amazing place, especially for a large fun group. We had several couples traveling from Washington State for a May wedding in Austin. We also had several more friends who live in Austin come over to the ranch and join us for a big pool party and BBQ.

The property owner was very nice, easy to talk to, quick to respond to our questions. I highly recommend this property.

Plenty of bedrooms for all the couples, plenty of kitchen space to accommodate all the chefs, and definitely plenty of lounging around areas inside and outside for socializing.

The ""party barn"" was perfect for our ping-pong competitions, poker tournaments, and more socializing. The home furnishings were very comfortable and ""felt like home"". We did a lot of entertaining during our stay, so a big kitchen was definitely a huge plus. The kitchen was full of everything we could possibly need. We even ate some of the farm fresh eggs from the property chickens. The pool and patio areas were very clean and there were plenty of towels for everyone.

None of us wanted to leave the ranch, we all loved it so much. We all plan on coming back.

2,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p169977#reviews,"Feb 2, 2010",5/5,Rocking Great Time,"What a fabulous place to stay with a group! There was honestly something for everyone in our group of fifteen with ages spanning 97 years....we went to celebrate my Dad's 100th birthday and the youngest great grand child is three.

We were met by the owner who showed us around the beautiful house, pool, fire pits, party barn, goat pens, chicken hutch. It was quite spectacular, very clean, gorgeous views, so private and perfect! But if you forgot something you had the HEB grocery and shopping 2 minutes away!

We could not have had more fun or have found a better place!

3,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p169977#reviews,"Nov 2, 2009",5/5,Wonderful wedding venue!,"Wow, the Rockin Y Ranch was a fabulous venue for our daughter's wedding in August!! We were able to house our extended family & bridesmaids which allowed more visiting and family time. The accomodations were especially helpful for grandparents who were in their 80s. By having both the wedding and the reception on the ranch we were able to enjoy the beauty of the outdoor location and didn't spend time traveling from venue to venue. Texas Blooms provided beautiful flowers for our daughter's wildflower theme and Pappasito's catered a wonderful Fiesta reception, complete with a strolling mariachi band! The wild beauty of the ranch provided a wedding day to remember always. Our photographer was enthralled with all the photographic opportunities. Our wedding guests pronounced this ranch experience to have been the best wedding yet and we are eagerly waiting for another opportunity to rent the Rockin Y Ranch again!

The barn with the pool table and fozz ball table was enjoyed and the goats were very friendly.

The best part was Teaspoon the aging lab - made us feel right at home!

We will be back next October

5,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p169977#reviews,"Jul 12, 2009",5/5,Family Reunion/Rehearsal Dinner,"Our family enjoyed a five day stay at the Rockin Y that included hosting 60 guests for a Rehearsal Dinner BBQ for our son's Austin wedding. Everything about the stay was delightful from the eclectic Texas decor throughout the main house and barn playroom to our entertaining and helpful landlord Eric. The home is spacious making it comfortable for a diverse group, and the grounds and play barn offer hours of entertainment without ever getting in the car. Amenities of the house were beyond expectations, especially the kitchen which accommodated all the needs of our catering chef and staff. The Ranch is close to stores, and local restaurants...even those who deliver pizza late at night! Downtown Austin is just 15 minutes away and is served by local taxi services. Our family and guests throughly enjoyed the Ranch and would recommend it to anyone, especially those who are looking to experience the real Austin and Hill Country hospitality.

6,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p169977#reviews,"Jun 17, 2009",5/5,Wonderful Weekend!,"I'm originally from Austin and wanted to have a wedding celebration party there for all the folks who couldn't make it over to the UK. This was absolutely perfect - could not have asked for anything better! We set up for about 80 guests under the trees by the pool and got the Salt Lick to cater a BBQ dinner, and we had an afternoon pool party as well. The party barn was great - I saw guests playing ping pong and poker and darts all evening, and we had a lovely night dancing under the stars by the pool. A lot of people ended up sleeping on couches as it was so fun no one wanted to leave! Eric is a great host and showed us everything we needed to have a memorable party and I would recommend this place highly.

"
7,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p169977#reviews,"Jun 9, 2009",5/5,Wonderful Wedding weekend,"We had our wedding and reception/party at the Rockin'Y Ranch. This house was just absolutely perfect for us! We had 4 people from out of state, our grown children and other family members stay with us. We had chosen a beautiful place to be married outside and when we had very heavy rain move in about 1-2 hours before the wedding!! we were able to move furniture out of the living room and still have a beautiful ceremony! The party barn was perfect as we had a band....plenty of room for dancing as well as pool table and seating area for everyone. The kitchen is awesome! So much room to move around...which was VERY important as we were cooking all the food Friday night for the reception. We enjoyed the fire pit Sat. after the band left and the rain was long since gone. The pool was a great asset for the hot afternoons. And EVERYONE has to sit on the upstairs deck at some point of your stay....the view is awesome!! Amazing how much solitude & peace you feel although in the middle of a neighborhood! We are very much wanting to return in the near future. Thank you everyone with and at the Rockin Y

8,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p169977#reviews,"Feb 22, 2009",5/5,Wedding Bliss,"Our daughter's wedding was in the vicinity of the Rockin'Y Ranch a couple of days ago. We had guests coming in from around the country. The Rockin'Y was the PERFECT accommodation for all of us. We all felt relaxed and at home. We were able to mingle with one another or retreat to a secluded corner or even hang out in the Party Barn.

Fabulous!

Plenty of elbow room.

The owner was accomodating to our needs and answered all questions. He was thorough with his tour and even intuitive to our circumstance well above our expectations.

To top all of great things off, we had an ""After Wedding Breakfast"" at the ranch for the bride and groom as well as out of town guests and friends on both sides. Folks found the place easily, were taken aback by its atmosphere and were very complimentary of the facility and ambiance. Again, the Rockin' Y was a perfect setting for that event. We prepared all food for the event in the ranch's exemplory kitchen.

Our guests at the Rockin' Y were already talking about using it for their Austin engagements in the future. One guest said that he would plan a reunion just so that he could use the facility.

We can not say enough good about our stay. Our youngest guest was 7 and oldest 84 years of age.

The place was to be mellow, safe and economical. (To house our guests in hotel rooms, we would have spent as much or more and would have not had the sense of community found at the Rockin' Y.

"
9,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p169977#reviews,"Jan 28, 2009",5/5,Best in Austin,"I cannot say enough about this property. We rented this for a casual wedding reception weekend with most guest coming from out of town. We wanted a place that would allow all of our friends to stay with us (no hotels) and we wanted to feel like we had our privacy, but not so far out that people would get lost driving there. The ranch has sooooo much space allowing the older folks to chat in the living room, football on the big screen in the family room, louder party action in the barn (coolest party barn ever!) and then the relaxing walks through the catcus garden and back of property. The kitchen has everything we needed to serve 36 people a good ole texas bar b q. And slept 14 people with no issues.

 I would not hesitate to recommend this place for any family, big group, or even private getaway. Eric and his staff are VERY friendly and easy to work with. They made sure our event was perfect.

Location is another asset of this place. We took a $10 cab from downtown that took no more than 10 minutes. You really cant find a secluded space with amazing starlight views, thats only minutes from downtown. This really helped give our guests the true ""Texas"" experience.

The Rockin' Y is responsible for a wonderful memory, and we WILL be returning. You wont find a better place in Austin. Thanks again!

"
10,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p169977#reviews,"Nov 18, 2008",5/5,Hidden oasis in the suburbs,"What I love most is that this place is tucked away off a plain old residential street, on what used to be the outskirts of Austin but is now pretty much ""in town""... but once you go down the driveway, you're in another world! We had 11 adults and two kids staying there. From the 87-year-old to the 6-year-old, everyone was accommodated and happy (including our dog!). The goats, donkey and chickens were fabulous for those who liked them, and out of sight for the visiting city folk who preferred not to co-mingle with the livestock. The kitchen table was big enough for shared meals (the industrial stove and grill are a cook's dream), but the grounds and house offer plenty of space for privacy as well.

And of course, there's nothing like a firepit on a hilltop on a cool Austin fall evening! I've rented a few out-of-town vacation houses just for get-togethers with local friends, and will add the Rockin' Y to my list. True, it's not *really* out in the country, it just feels that way, so you do hear the highway during the day. But you can't beat the convenient location, the space, and the facilities.

The owner was very easy to work with, and graciously rounded up and returned the various items we left there.

HIghly recommended for local get-aways, family/friend reunions, or for any out-of-towners looking for a wonderful alternative to downtown hotels. We'll be back!

11,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p169977#reviews,"Aug 20, 2008",5/5,Much needed reunion with old friends!,"I stayed were with a bunch of old friends of mine, some with kids and some without. The place is awesome, very accommodating on every level! Clean, spacious everything and more than I expected. What I loved most is the layout is such where if there are children, or anyone else who wants peace and quiet, they can retreat to the other side of the house and not be bothered with the noise from the rest of the group. The pool was the kicker though for me...my daughter had the best time and so did I!!! We have already decided this will be a annual event for us so we will be back next year! Anyone wanting to rent this property take my advice, you won't be disappointed!

"
12,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p169977#reviews,"Aug 14, 2008",4/5,Awesome and Great Place within the City!,"I came here w/ a great group of old friends for a mini reunion..some w/ kids and some without. The house has a great layout for any and all groups -4 bdrms on one side of the house and 3 bdrms on the other. Kitchen and living areas all btwn the two. So much room and so many areas to not only retreat on your own, but also to really keep the late night noise contained away from the light sleepers and kids. Kitchen has everything you need and the owner was very helpful to make sure we knew where everything was. Pool is great as well! All so close to downtown, we will definitly come back. Thank you Eric for everything!!

13,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p169977#reviews,"Aug 5, 2008",4/5,CHARMING AND RELAXING,"Some friends and I stayed at the Rocking Y this past weekedn (Aug 1-3, 2008) and it was just like staying at a old friends house. The house was so comfortable and relaxing, and they had everything we needed to relax and enjoy our stay. The beds were comfortable and the place was clean. I would definitely stay here again. Also, it's so close to the downtown Austin area, if you wanted to go out for the evening you can without having to drive a long distance, yet you still feel like you are out in the country while on the property. AWESOME experience!

"
14,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p169977#reviews,"Jun 24, 2008",5/5,Perfect for a large group,"The Rockin Y Ranch was lovely.

I stayed there with 15 other gals for a girlfriend's bachelorette party and had a wonderful time.

With 2 girls per room it slept all of us very comfortably.

The large kitchen, two large living areas, and huge backyard with pool provided us all plenty of space to cook, sunbathe, swim, hike, and enjoy the property.

The rooms were all decorated with texas charm and very comfortable.

I would definitely consider this place again for a large get together or family reunion.

16,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p169977#reviews,"Jun 23, 2008",5/5,The Greatest Vacation...,"From the moment we drove up and were greeted by the owner to the moment we left, I thoroughly enjoyed this warm, inviting, spacious home. I felt like I was finally on a real vacation! We loved the pool, fire pits, BBQ, scenery, fresh eggs laid by the chickens, the convenience of a fully stocked home and of course ""Teaspoon"" our optional built-in security dog. Teaspoon was amazingly entertaining & took care of himself by letting himself in and out of the house on his own. The owner was so warm and friendly and really made us feel like we were in our own home or like family. The closeness of the shopping center was also a plus. I would highly recommend staying here and cannot wait to return one day.

18,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p169977#reviews,"Jun 23, 2008",5/5,the perfect option!,"we recently hosted a bachelor/bachelorette party here and we LOVED the rockin' y...plenty of communal space for us to do group activities and spacious enough for it to never feel crowded. the pool is beautiful and the provides the perfect respite from those hot, Austin summer days, loads of bedrooms to accommodate any grouping of people, a HUGE kitchen to make eggs in the morning (fresh ones are provided if you wish) and a great BBQ with smoker makes for the perfect poolside dinners. ask Eric to give you some of his favorite recipes and request the house dog, Teaspoon, to stay with you during your stay - she's an amazing host!! you won't be disappointed here. oh, and Austin is only about 10 minutes away if you feel you must leave...which we never did.

"
19,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p169977#reviews,"May 14, 2008",5/5,Perfection,"The Rocking Y Ranch exceeded our expectations. We spent a week here in May. We were in town for a wedding and 12 others joined us for 3 to 5 days. At one time, there were a total of 14. We were not the least bit crowded. It was very humid and the pool offered us instant relief. Great surroundings, friendly dog and chickens (fresh eggs). I can't begin to tell you all the fun we had. It wouldn't have been the same any where else. Eric and Will were most helpful and provided us with all of the comforts of home. We had a meet & greet party for family and friends around the pool. With the party service people and our group, there were about 40 people; plenty of space!

20,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p169977#reviews,"Apr 29, 2008",5/5,Reunion for 13 people in Austin,"Property is charming, clean and very private. A quick drive to downtown Austin. Amenities are great -- BBQ, 2 fire pits, ping pong and poker table and a pool. We were a large group of law school classmates there for a long weekend reunion and enjoyed ourselves very much. The owner was very accommodating and friendly, and left us to enjoy ourselves. Only drawback is that the pool is not heated, so keep that in mind if you are going during the colder months. We were there in mid-April though and it was warm enough to swim, so I doubt it is ever much of an issue.

The house set up was perfect for our family & it was great to have full amenities to stay put after a crazy few days of college graduation festivities for our daughter. It was very relaxing & comfortable.

We rented a boat one day to go water skiing & tubing. The marina was close, convenient & a boat is a great way to enjoy the lake.

When we had an issue with the satellite TV the owners were quick to reply & have the situation fixed. Everything else went smoothly....we would definitely consider staying here again!

We were in Austin with the intent to visit extended family on Hudson Bend without being intrusive, and this simple and welcoming guest house was a great solution in a beautiful setting. Our group of 9 (including 3 small children under the age of 3) thoroughly enjoyed the ample living / dining space and beautiful and spacious outdoor space - especially the dock and access to the water where the kids and adults alike could explore, swim and take full advantage of being outside and on the lake. The house was ready for us when we arrived, had instructions for anything we needed during our 6 day visit, and accommodated our comings-and-goings to visit family nearby incredibly well. This is a guest house located in close proximity to the main house, but we certainly enjoyed the views and had almost full access to the property, so it was certainly no issue for our stay. Thank you to Phyllis for making this property available - it suited our visit incredibly well! Will certainly look into this option again in the future.

The huge backyard was great to throw the football/frisbee and it is pretty close to Austin.

30,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p186314vb#reviews,"Sep 5, 2017",5/5,Beautiful!,"Had a wonderful Labor Day weekend staying here with family. If you enjoy the water as much as we do, this is a great swimming spot. The swim dock was really great. We packed a gourmet lunch and took it down to the water and pretty much spent all day there. They had umbrellas which was nice when you wanted to get out of the sun. The water can be a little rough as this is a busy lake but there is a nice beach entrance if you have little ones. It was very relaxing just to swim and watch all the boats. The property is beautiful. There are nice views of the lake, we enjoyed sitting out on the patio in the evenings and even while eating our meals in the main living area we enjoyed the views. If you like bird watching there is a lot to see. The house is well equipped and the beds were comfortable. The area has lots of eateries and shops. We enjoyed the drive from North Austin up to the lake. We will definitely be returning to this beautiful property!

"
31,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p186314vb#reviews,"Aug 17, 2017",5/5,Great home. Beautiful lake,"We had a great stay on Lake Travis at this property. The house had a very well stocked kitchen and was comfortable for our family. There are 3 bedrooms, but the one bedroom is a walk thru to the back room so if you have anyone with privacy issues, they may not want to stay in the middle room. However, the back room has a private entrance, so you could work it out if it was really inconvenient. The dock was fun to hang out on and with some creativity, we were able to tie up the 25 foot pontoon boat we rented for the weekend. We launched the boat at the dam and it was just a short ride to the house. The lake level was high and we had a great time, puttering around. Unfortunately there was a burn ban in effect and we weren't able to use the great fire pit. Would love to go back on a little cooler day to enjoy the great lawn and play some volley ball or frisbee.

The kitchen/dining/living area is a spacious open floor plan with lots of room for lounging, watching tv, and visiting with other guests. The back deck has a beautiful view of the lake. The kitchen was well equipped for us to cook a big Thanksgiving dinner. The owners ensured that we were provided what we needed to have a bonfire on the beach by the lake. We will definitely stay here again.

33,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p186314vb#reviews,"Jul 23, 2016",3/5,Pleasant owners. Nice updated home without a view,"The home is older but nicely updated. The lot is narrow and very long with the owners very large home right in front of the view to the lake. We brought a 22' wakeboard boat which the owners asked and knew of. The swim dock is the designated area for guests boats with no cover(shade)or cleats to tie up to. The swim dock had 2 1/2 feet of water when we arrived according to my depth finder and the lake was full during our stay. A few days later the owner extended the swim dock out a little further to 4 feet. I would not recommend this rental for guests with boats. It is the number one reason we came to stay and I was always checking and worried about the boat because it isn't protected from large waves from a very busy lake. Our boat had some damage during our stay tied up at the dock :(

"
34,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p186314vb#reviews,"Jul 10, 2016",5/5,Great place to stay on the lake!,"We stayed here last weekend and it was great! The house is beautiful and the property is amazing. I docked my 21ft Skiboat on their dock with no problems. It was pretty windy and there are no cleats so take plenty of fenders and some rope. You can tie off to a few places on the dock. It's only 4-5ft deep off the dock but you can anchor about 40 ft off the dock for bigger boats.

House is stocked with the important things like dishes and other essential items.

I would stay here again in a heart beat! Thank you for the great memory!

Beautiful property with direct access to the lake and a marina to rent a boat! My buddies and I had a blast over the weekend and we will definitely plan on coming back in the future. Everything in the house was immaculate and well stocked so we didn't have to worry about anything from towels, to pots and pans, and utensils. Phyllis is also super sweet and very accommodating.

The kitchen was well-stocked with pots, pans, and anything you could possibly need.

The lake set up was fantastic. J.R. was kind enough to let us use his private/family dock. It had a great sound system, a fridge, and a nice outdoor kitchen setup (bar top/ outdoor table/ etc). It was also nice to have a place to get out of the sun and get some protection from the wind.

He responds to all emails and treats you like his own family. The property is the best on the lake, not to mention the cleanest and best stocked property I have ever rented. I brought charcoal for the grill, it was supplied. The kitchen has all the necessities, including coffee and trash bags, pots and pans. In a world of terrible customer service, this is paradise!! The dock and swimming area is as good as it gets!! Can't say enough, I will be a return customer.

41,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p186314vb#reviews,"Jul 7, 2015",2/5,Did not expect the birds or layout,"Overall we had a good family vacation at this property. The owners are kind people who are renting out the house behind theirs as a vacation property. The property was clean, spacious, and we had direct access to two boat docks and the lake.

But we also ran into two major issues. The first was that birds were nesting in the chimney and were very loud. This made it hard to relax in the main living area which is the best part of the house. We notified the owners and they indicated it would be addressed, but there was not followup. We didn't expect the birds to be removed because it would risk harming them, but given the cost we had higher expectations that problems like this would be addressed before our stay. (i.e. a repaired chimney cap or sharply discounted rate) If it were not for the bird problem we would have rated our stay better. The second issue had to do with the layout of the house. To access one of the bedrooms you either have to walk through the middle bedroom or walk outside and then through the front door. This wasn't as big of a problem as the birds but it is something that other renters should be made aware of if they happened to miss it during review of the property.

We could not have asked for a more wonderful owner. He went above and beyond to make sure our stay was the best possible. I can't say anything bad about our stay. Even with the bad weather we had a fabulous stay! The house was perfect for our family and clean! Love the open floor plan which we enjoyed with our family so much! We enjoyed eating outside on the patio too ! Kitchen well equipped !! Can't wait to go back soon ! With the rain the lake level is coming up quite well too!! Thank you again Mr . Lacey for making this a great weekend for our family.

43,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p186314vb#reviews,"Mar 17, 2014",1/5,Lake Travis property,"The pics online reveal for the most part all rooms but it doesn't reveal it needs renovation, updating and a new cleaning crew. We were disappointed that the bed coverings, pillows and mattresses were in poor and dirty condition. Some of the sheets on the beds looked as though they had not been washed from the previous guests. There were bugs and dead roaches in pantry. The utility/laundry room had a broken door and washer/dryer were filthy. Outdoor patio area was most disappointing, as it had not been cleaned for new guests. Patio table and furniture had dead bugs, cobwebs, dried bird droppings. We had to buy our own small BBQ pit to cook outdoors due to the 3 they had there were filthy with bird droppings and leftover mess from previous guest.

In the queen bed room with own bathroom, the tub did not drain well at all. The tub would fill up with dirty bath water before finishing our shower. The top bunk bed has poor springs and bottom cover to that bed was torn with hole that hangs down into bottom bed.

Overall the house has an old musty smell. We bought candles to help with odor.

We did take advantage of the volleyball court area outside and the fire pit. The water level is low in lake so you can't fish from docks on property. Not that you would want to, as one of the docks is in worse condition than the house.

Needless to say, we were very disappointed with our stay. Considering what we paid, the house and overall condition should have exceeded our expectations. Unless this property has a total makeover and remodel, we would not recommend this property.

44,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p186314vb#reviews,"Sep 6, 2013",5/5,Labor Day Weekend - 2013,"A very good, well maintained, property. We really enjoyed our stay. There were only three minor issues.

1) The A/C vent grill in the master bath was missing.

2) The hot water was too hot, almost scalding, in the kitchen. The temp setting for the water heater was too high and should probably be lowered.

3) It was pitch black at night as there were no night lights at all, making a trip to the bathroom during the night an adventure.

The kids really enjoyed the bunk beds. The kitchen was well stocked with cooking utensils, pots, and pans. excellent flat screen TV, comfortable furniture, lots of seating for meals, a great patio table and chairs with an umbrella. It was great eating breakfast on the patio.

"
46,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p186314vb#reviews,"Oct 24, 2012",2/5,Nice place but needed a good cleaning,"We arrived at the house that sits on a beautiful property in the middle of the afternoon. Initially we thought the home was lovely, but as we looked closer, there were cob webs in the corners, bugs behind TV, froot loops and lifesavers stuck on the sofa and futon and the floors were filthy. We had to actaully throw our socks away after walking on them.

There was laundry in both the washer and dryer, which the owner did come over to tell us about. The master bedroom had a really bad odor. We opened 4 bars of soap and laid then around the room, which thankfully helped.

The other issue is that the pictures are kind of deceptive in the sense that it appears as though there are 2 queen bedrooms, but there is only a King/bath, (1) Queen w/bath and a bunk-bed room that has a bath through a closet. My error for not confirming.

Other than that, the house itself was very comfortable and the common area was a nice place to gather. I would advise the owner, who was very nice, to reevaluate their cleaning service (if they have one).

Its a shame because the house has an enormous amount of potential...

The water level was about 40 feet or so below normal so it was a little hike down to the water but the owner made up for that by graciously offering us use of his personal boat dock which was amazing. The house was very clean and living area was very open to kitchen/dining area! Great space! We loved this place!! The main patio off the back living room was comfortable and offered the view of Lake Travis! The owners were also very friendly and accommodating! Recommend highly. We will be back!

It is fully equipped with all necessary appliances, plus it had some extra perks such as complimentary shampoo and disposable utensils. Not to mention, the BBQ pits that they have in the back patio. The property is at a perfect location, it's only four minutes from the marina where you have access to rent a boat, which we did... We didn't have to drive far for dinner either, Carlos & Charlie's is also next to the marina.

Small and comfortable with lots of windows opening onto a heavily wooded setting. About a mile to South Congress which is one of the best places to visit and only about 1.5 miles to 6th street where a lot of the music is. Also not far from Barton Springs and the best brisket in town at Terry Black's. Hosts are helpful but not intrusive. Since this is in a heavily wooded area, the hosts advise that renters may hear small animals at night or see bugs on occasion, although they spray for insects frequently. This was not an issue for us but if prospective renters are from an urban area and are unused to that, it should factor into the rental decision. But for us overall, this was an exceptionally nice experience.

The nights were chilly in Jan so the extra blankets, house coats and portable heater were a very nice touch! The rooms were very clean, comfortable linens and towels. While a gourmet dinner may be a challenge, the kitchen was equipped for daily cooking. The accordion door to the bathroom does not afford much privacy.

I booked this property three months in advance (Jan. for a three-night stay in April) and had my reservation cancelled THREE DAYS before arrival with a message stating that the property was booked on another site ""back in December."" So either the host found someone else willing to pay a higher price for their property (of note: the weekend was during a large event in Austin) or the host is so disorganized that he/she didn't realize a double booking for THREE FULL MONTHS. Either way, I was left scrambling to find new lodging on extremely short notice, for which I paid double the price of my original booking.

You're not that far from the hike and bike trail or the restaurants on South Congress. The best part of the place is the porch. The porch has an AC which makes it possible to enjoy staying out without suffering the oppressive summer heat of Texas. My dog loved this porch!

Minutes away from up-and-coming neighborhoods, and old staples—I was able to have a great weekend reprieve connecting with dear friends and taking in the every-changing Austin. Kim provides a great compilation of things to do, and their home is also super close to one of the two major roadways that cuts through the city. This would be a great place to stay for ACL or SxSW, because it is the perfect retreat after a long day of festivities. It is incredibly quiet and peaceful and super close to one of my favorite coffee shops: Cherrywood Coffeehouse. EnJOY!

The apartment had all the amenities of home, and provided us with more room than we would have had in a traditional hotel room. Our two teenage boys enjoyed the space as well. I especially liked that I could run up to the local grocery store for milk, cereal, and other snack items. Kim was a fantastic host! I can't say enough nice things about her and her family.

The kitchen was complete with everything we needed, it even has a blender. The Queen size bed is very comfortable. There is a loft with an inflatable mattress which is where our son slept. The treehouse has the feel of a regular apartment rather than a studio. Kim is an amazing host. She made us feel at home and was extremely helpful. I now understand what they mean by southern hospitality. The treehouse is centrally located, we attended an event at the convention center and drove there in 12 minutes. The campus is even closer.

The owners are delightful -caring and discreet- they give you just as much privacy as you could want.

It really was a wonderful base in which to explore Austin and the local area. Firstly, the owners are immensely friendly and helpful. Nothing seemed too much trouble. Although the apartment is in he grounds of their house, you also have complete privacy. Secondly, it's a very nice apartment - comfortable, and with a good amount of space for a 'treehouse studio'. Thirdly, it's very well placed indeed. Cherrywood is a very nice neighborhood. There are a range of excellent places to eat pretty much a block away on Manor Road. There are a couple of big supermarkets nearby (the Fiesta is walkable). It's only a few minutes onto the UT campus. There's also a (very punctual) bus route (#21) that takes you downtown in a matter of minutes. We stayed without a car, and did not feel constrained - or at least not more constrained than we would have been if we would have stayed anywhere else. Downtown doesn't have that much going for it, aside from a load of tacky bars. SoCo is fine, particularly for over-priced hipster stuff. But the resturants on Manor Road are very nice and laid back.

It is actually like a tree house in that it is up with the trees. The natural light is awesome but was easy to shut out as we slept late often. My 5 year old absolutely loved the loft and insisted on sleeping there while I was surprised to have such a comfortable bed. The flat screen TV/DVD was mounted on the wall where it could be viewed from the bed or the living area. Kim and her husband were also great with ideas of where to go and what to do and when. Highly recommended! It is the best compliment to Austin one could expect.

The studio is very clean, comfortable, and charming. Kim provided excellent coffee, and a fresh bottle of cream was in the fridge when I arrived! The neighborhood felt very safe, and except for a hum from the highway, it was very quiet. I think you'd pretty much want a car to get downtown, to UT-Austin, to South Congress, or anywhere else, but Austin is very easy to navigate.

It was ok. The pics made the home seem larger than it actually was. I would say the home comfortably accommodates 6 people, not 8. The parking was not as described in the instruction sheet. We had a hard time finding silverware &amp; trash bags, not knowing that there were hidden drawers inside the cabinets and there was an unpleasant odor when we first arrived, I would say the overall cleanliness was average to below. The ½ bath was tiny you could barely close the door or your legs would be up against it. The best part about the house was the rooftop deck, however, they need more chairs &amp; tables up there and probably some type of umbrella when it gets hot. Overall satisfaction would be a 3-

The place was nice with a great rooftop patio to lounge at when the sun goes down. The AC was set at a cool 69 degrees when we arrived and everything for the most part was exactly as it was advertised. However, the hot water for the house stopped running on the first day of our trip so we were forced to take nothing but cold showers for the rest of our trip. The tablet that the property came with was dangerous to use as the battery pack appeared to have exploded (as the tablet was considerably bulging in the middle) and should have been replaced a while ago. The place was also fairly dirty and was not at the standard of the AirBnB I'm used to.

Great ""party house"" for my best friends bachelor party. Rooftop was awesome area with speakers and plenty of space. Two negatives for me were getting in. It took about 20 minutes to get in because we were given an incorrect code originally and then each time we needed to get back into the house we had to put in about a 10 digit code. Other then that the only other semi complaint was the location. Alittle run down but we had 8 guys so it wasnt a worry for us.

I booked this house for a bachelor party in early June. The house is nice but the rental agency was terrible. Since the listing says it sleeps 10, I contacted the rental agency to ask if it would comfortably sleep 10 adult males...fully grown, mid-30's, American corn-fed dudes. I was immediately reassured that it would be no problem, and that there were even extra air mattresses. It turns out it barely fits 5 small cuddling couples...with at least 2 people squeezed onto the 1 air mattress available. TurnKey makes a point of emailing often and asking ""Is there anything we can do to make your stay more comfortable?"" I'm sure this makes them look GREAT if you don't need anything. However, should you ask for any assistance...they're out. Zero help. After we arrived, they called and apologized because it turned out that garbage day was going to be during our stay, and the cans would have to be taken to the curb. They offered to send someone over to take the cans out, but we're 10 capable adults so I said it was no problem; we'll take care of it. BUT, we asked if it would be possible to get a couple air mattresses sent over? Nope. We asked for a small discount, since it was not as advertised. Nope. Is there ANYTHING you can do to help accommodate us? Nope, sorry. I eventually ordered two cheap air mattresses and paid to have them delivered to the house (since we did not have a car). So, I asked for TurnKey if they would reimburse me for the $50 or so that I spent on air mattresses since I was going to leave them at the house (we all had to fly home and had no way to take them)...and, nope. Basically, I would highly recommend that you rent elsewhere, purely because the rental agency ruined our experience at an otherwise nice place. As for the house...great location, nice place, a perfectly breezy roof deck, etc. I've never been burned by a VRBO rental before...and it sucks that I'm now way more skeptical when booking.

The location is a little weird, but it was only about a $8 cab to the bars or a 25-30 minute walk. For the price, it was great! Most of the houses actually right in downtown were at least double the price, so it was worth it to stay a mile away in this place and spend a little bit of $$ on cabs!

Very convenient location. Not enough delineation between what was space for the owner sometime resident and renter sometime residents. Limited spaces for clothing to be hung and food to be stored, for example. Cable TV amenities etc were available but not intuitive to operate fully and efficiently. The facility was not spotlessly clean and this was a constant negative throughout our short stay. Some of the resources were high and almost out of reach without a ladder -- towel rack, microwave oven are examples of inaccessibility due to height.

Even though we loved exploring Austin, we always looked forward to coming back to our weekend home.

It had a very urban chic feel to it, with all new kitchen appliances, concrete floors, a very open layout with two-story open ceilings in all of the bottom floor rooms, and attractive, well-kept furniture.

The listing was accurate, and it even had more space than it mentioned! The sliding glass doors opened up to a cool patio and yard in the front, and made a great place to sit out and let the Austin breeze come in. The kitchen was completely updated, as were the bathrooms. The master bath had a huge tub and a rain shower - I felt like I was in a super swanky hotel!

The property was very clean and well-maintained, and the owner provided very thorough instructions and multiple keys for our additional guests. They gave us access to a Wii, movies to watch, and games to play!

This house is in a super-cute neighborhood right on a bus line that takes you directly downtown, within walking distance of Torchy's Tacos (YUM!) and a few cute little breakfast spots and coffee joints. Burnet Road as well as N. Lamar have both recently exploded with new restaurants, bars and little boutique shops so it's great to be able to pop in to those places, but also be close to downtown Austin (SoCo and 6th street areas).

But Deborah met my friend who flew in earlier than me and did the walk through with her instead which was more than amazing. Also my dog sitter canceled the day before the trip and she was fine with me bringing my pup literally last minute. No words to express the gratitude I've got for that :) The house is so cute and well put together in an eclectic bohemian chic way that fit my group perfectly. The back yard is a sanctuary of serenity! We enjoyed the front porch as well. Our favorite thing may have been the stair case that changed colors constantly. Gave it a great vibe.

We also loved the beautiful yard, front and back! We ended every evening on the front porch, enjoying the serenity of the peaceful community. We hit all the must do's of Austin so greatly appreciated the comfortable and inviting beds. Debb is very friendly and accommodating, and truly wants people to enjoy their stay in her wonderful home. I would highly recommend this as a terrific place to stay!

The listing descriptions were very accurate and the property was clean and well maintained. The owner provided excellent customer service and had a ""welcome goodies"" on the kitchen table. We enjoyed the shop and restaurants on Congress Street as well as the music scene on 6th Street. The home does have many stairs/steps to access the front and rear of the home and this would be difficult to manage for the disabled. We will certainly consider returning and would recommend this home to friends and relatives.

It accurately matched the description online, and provided everything we needed for a comfortable stay. We wanted to be near downtown, and this was the perfect fit - we could walk to many of the venues we had scheduled, and yet the setting was quiet and secluded.

Deborah was a delight to work with, and was helpfully attentive throughout the registration process, our stay, and in follow up contact. She had prepared local maps, current activities info, and much more tourist info than we could use. Her decorating tastes are wonderfully eclectic, and nestled in a quiet heavily wooded part of the Clarksville neighborhood her home was indeed, as our grandson described, “a fairy tale house.”

Our weekend was hot and muggy, but the dual AC units worked perfectly, and our times together “at home” were “not too hot; not too cold; but just right.”

When we return to Austin, or San Antonio (only an hour away) we may very well stay in the fairy tale house again. Thanks, Deborah, for a wonderful time.

We had originally hoped to not have to rent a car but ultimately did and were happy to have it for access to see more of Austin I'd recommend getting a rental car. We didn't have much luck with taxis but Uber was readily available and a go-to option for getting around in the evening. Deborah was an amazing host and everything was as advertised. The house has a ton of character and it is a reflection of it's owner who did everything to make us feel at home. Highly recommend this for any families or groups of friends looking for a great place to have a family friendly time in Austin. We would definitely plan to stay here again on a future trip to Austin.

We didn't use them to go out to dinner at night, but they were very useful when we wanted to check out different parts of the city during the day.

We were 5 business women wanting a break from South Padre. We had great times out on the porch drinking wine and watching people.

We loved all the decorations and art pieces in the home. It has a very historic feel yet very livable. We walked to Zilker park on some beautiful trails.

We felt a good vibe as soon as we arrived and met Deborah, our lovely hostess. This home had plenty of space for us, indoors and out. We spent a lot of time on the back patio, sipping our morning coffees and planning our days, or relaxing with a cold bevereage after a busy day of Austin sightseeing. Having two showers and three toilets (each of them with a night light!) was very handy too. This is a well-equipped and well-maintained home, and it is decorated with a variety of art pieces. There are also lots of Austin-related info pieces; cards and brochures for goods, shops and services for visitors. The beds were very comfortable.

The location is great, just a short walk east to el Arroyo, a.k.a. The Ditch, for some lovely Mexican food and fun wait staff. Right across from the restaurant is the Mean-Eyed Cat, a Johnny Cash shrine/bar built around a tree. Just down 5th St is Donns Depot, another eclectic music venue built from railcars, where Donn's country swing band keeps the patrons of all ages dancing the night away.

From the house it is about a 20-minute walk to Whole Foods, Lululemon etc, but the exercise is a good way to work up an appetite! There are also several buses along 5th St that will take you downtown for $1 - unless you get tempted to take a yoga class or visit one of the spas along the route.

I would recommend this property to any group of 4-6 people who prefer to stay in a quiet, beautiful neighbourhood away from the hustle & noise of downtown, yet still be within a short bus ride or enjoyable walk to the city centre.

The listing for this property was absolutely right on target! There were no surprises at all. The house was well equipped and had everything that we needed including games, music, etc. Our granddaughter sat down on the sofa and wanted to stay right there. Everything was extremely comfortable inside and out. The backyard area was great; and even though neighbors were close, you had complete privacy. The natural yard made you feel that you were not in town at all. The neighborhood was very quiet and we got a good feel for ""Austin living."" We choose some of the restaurants that were close by and loved dining outside.

The downtown area was very close but you would need to drive. It was a little too far to walk. While we were there we even went to Barton Springs. It is a lovely natural (large) pool area that our granddaughter enjoyed immensely!

The house is quaint, interesting, comfortable, and perfect ""Austin.""

However the art did not get in the way of it being a very functional place to stay for a sizeable family.

The location was convenient to absolutely everything we wanted to do, just minutes from highways and restuarants, but still nestled in a quiet and friendly neighborhood and with a really pretty yard (the pictures don't do it justice!). This is a gem of a 1920's home with wonderful architectural detail and significant interior and exterior renovations.

This location was 2 minutes to the bride's mother (my best friend), 6 minutes to the venue, 15 minutes to my daughter and best yet, a 5 block walk to South Congress for the 30 year old kids. We've been coming to Austin for many years and spend most of our time between Travis Heights and the UT area and this home couldn't be better for that. And now there is a Torchy's in the neighborhood!

The home was clean, well equipped and large. Lots of rooms for people to gather or find a room to themselves. Beds were very comfortable. Plenty of hot water for so many showers. If you are looking for a cozy, yet large home, this is your place.

Great layout for a group of ladies- spent most of our time hanging out in the sunroom and outside patio areas. Although there are only 2 bathrooms, there is an extra vanity area which helped a lot. Did not have any big issues, but Cesar was just a call or text away in case we did. Of note, each time we used the oven, the fire alarm would start ringing. We just got used to fanning the area to quiet the alarm, but seems like the oven just needs a good cleaning. This did not negatively imact our stay as we got some good laughs out of everyone grabbing a towel or baking pan to fan the kitchen.

Someone was parked in our assigned parking space, we waited 24 hours and left a note on their windshield, but had to have them towed; then the next morning we found our car had been keyed (assuming it was the people who's car was towed because of us).

Overall, not a bad location, close to 6th street, walking distance to bars/restaurants. Watch the staircase, you might hit your head on it. Be careful when towing others vehicles, they might get mad and take it out on your car.

We've always stayed closer to Zilker in the past, so thought we'd mix it up a bit this year. It was the way to go! So convenient and close to all we wanted to do/see! Rainey Street, 6th Street, Republic Square to catch the shuttle to Zilker...all within a short walk. The Capital Metro Shuttle to the airport...at only $1.25 each way...was catty corner from the condo. Ideal location for us, no doubt!

The condo was easy to access thanks to the detailed instructions sent to us. It was air conditioned and had all the amenities we could need. We laughed and joked about a few of the quirks there...one of the bar table chairs was broken and couldn't be raised up; we had to keep reminding each other to duck and to watch our heads/back if we bent over near the spiral staircase, which is at a really strange spot. The staircase is also quite small, causing one of the women to just leave her suitcase downstairs as it was too difficult to lug it up.

Other impressions: the tv is very large...too large for that space and kind of in your face. Would be so much nicer to have a smaller one tucked back in to the alcove; the hall bathroom needs some repair: toilet seat moved around, needs some touch up paint around the towel bar; the kitchen ceiling (beneath the air conditioning vent, I believe) had mold on it and bubbling from a leak. A suggestion from the two women who stayed upstairs is to place a mirror on that level. Would have saved them from having to come downstairs to the kitchen and bathroom mirrors to put on make up. Also, the closet in one of the bedrooms was basically unusable and served as storage, apparently. Would have been nice to place our suitcases in there during our stay. As it was, we left them open on the floor.

Are all these little things I've noted enough to keep us from staying here again in the future if the opportunity arose? Nope! Great location and the price was right. Had everything we needed, and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay!

Even in July. 3rd floor, no elevator. If, your a bit older, avoid the stairs. Unit was okay at best. Needs some serious updating. If, this is an investment property, the owners need to allocate some much needed funding into brining it up to date. 4th time renting VRBO, first time I had very little personal service. Luckily in the past I have dealt with owners that welcomed me as if I were family or best friends. Not the case here. With that said, this is an easy fix. Customer service. A/C a bit drained late in the day. Throw rugs are very dirty. Bedding was okay. Body wash, shampoo & conditioner as well as towel service very good. Kitchen was a plus for our needs.

The condo is a block over from a fire station, there were partiers all three nights we stayed. The units all face inwardly into the courtyards or walkways, our unit was on the 3rd floor, so anyone talking, walking, running or yelling, you can hear.

I took the bus from the airport and it was a breeze. There is a hotel right across the street with plenty of cabs lined up if you want to go that route. I would recommend this location to anyone planning a fun and carefree trip to downtown Austin!

It is centrally located in downtown Austin, close to 6th street and sight seeing galore. The walls are very thin, though--both inside the condo and outside. So, you can hear everything your flat mates are doing AND everything going on outside the condo. If you're looking to spend a night out on the town, that's not much of a problem. But don't expect an incredible night's sleep.

Nice place, though, and would definitely stay again.

The location is perfect - a very short walk to all the restaurants & bars on 6th Street but far enough away to avoid the crowds and noise. About a 20 minute walk to the UT campus. The condo is very clean, well stocked & looks just like the pictures. Parking on site was very handy and the property manager was great. We would definitely recommend this place.

The up stairs was my favorite. My teen girls slept of there and loved it. Noise was not a problem. Parking was a problem. We're told we had two parking spots. On the day of arrival the two spots assigned were taken. After about 30 min one became available. I called the property manager and she said to go park in a parking garage. That's like $20. So I told her we didnt want to do that. We choose to park in an empty parking spot and put a note on the window with our phone number of we needed to move it. The manager never called back with a solution. We were thankful we were never called to move it or got towed. One other down side is to get the cars in and out of the gated parking you have to have a remote key. So when you first arrive you have to wait for some one to leave to get in. Also there is only one remote.

The location was great -- you could walk to restaurants, bars (Rainey St. 6th St), the convention center, shopping (South Congress) and plenty of entertainment. For the things not within walking distance, everything was a short Uber/Lyft away. The beds were comfortable and the apartment was spacious for our group. One huge benefit of the apartment was that since it is a keypad for entry- it's very convenient for groups who are travelling together but may be coming in and out at different times.

A few other notes- there is a Starbucks directly across the street which was a frequent stop for our group, the neighbors were all super friendly (and the majority that we encountered were young adults) , and the management was very responsive when we contacted them while we were there.

I would definitely recommend this rental to a family or group travelling to Austin and would stay there again if I returned!

This property is in a great location and certainly met our needs, but by no means is it luxurious. There is A LOT of street noise, if you are a light sleeper, like me, ear plugs are a must and the loft bedroom upstairs doesn’t have any window coverings so an eye mask is recommended. There was no bar soap in either bathroom and the liquid soap pump in one of the baths was empty. Both of the twin beds and one of the queens make a ridiculous amount of noise. It sounds minor but it’s very loud squeaking. All that said, this unit is a bargain option in an expensive location. It puts you in the heart of down town and a short walk from the food and music Austin is famous for.

This condo was the perfect place to stay! Location is great (some of our group was staying at the Hilton, so we were all just a block or so apart). Everywhere in downtown Austin was within walking distance (Congress area, the Capital, 6th St), so it was fun to really explore the area and live like a local for the weekend. (The $1 bus from the airport even stops within a block of the condo.)

My boyfriend and I stayed in the Master Bedroom, it was comfortable and nice to have our own bathroom. The only negative was that it got kind of stuffy in our room at night (the AC didnt seem to circulate as well in our room as in the rest of the condo).

The common area was cozy for curling up with a book or enjoying breakfast before heading out for the day. We didnt exactly cook, but I did eat in one night with random things I'd picked up at Whole Foods, and the kitchen was equipped with everything I needed to make dinner convenient.

The condo is beautifully appointed and has all the amenities one needs. We'd give this rental a ""good"" or even an ""excellent"" rating but for a few issues. The building was noisy, and the other guests or residents were rowdy. There was a lot of late-night noise/talking/gathering. That, coupled with noisy beds, made getting a good night's rest near impossible. We took 2 of the beds off of their frames and put them directly on the floor to reduce whatever noise was made with every movement in the bed. Also, the rental comes with two parking spaces, but every evening one of the available spots was taken - and of course it was the spot closest to our entrance. We hesitate to leave a ""negative"" review, because really, the condo is GREAT and the staff with whom we worked to rent the place was great! If the bed issues and the noise levels weren't there, we'd recommend this rental with glee. Overall, our excursion to Austin was fantastic, and much of that was attributable to this awesome location and charming condo. Thank you!

Major problem though with key fobs. There were six women staying in the condo and there are two key fobs. One fob opens the parking area and the other opens the main outside door and the condo door. While we tried to utilize leaving the fob in the lock box - it is very complicated. When one person returns to the condo alone, retrieves the key fob, lets themself into the condo - there is no way to put the fob back while you are still inside the condo. The outer door does not remain open long enough to allow you to put the fob back in the lock box. Then when the next person comes there is no fob in the lock box. They have to call around to find out who is in the condo and ask them to come down and let them in. Very frustrating. The condo is on the third floor so its a lot of up and down to let one another in and out. This system might work well for a couple staying in the unit but not for several people going in a variety of directions during the day and evening. Other than this we had a nice stay. The outside can be noisy at night with cars, sirens, etc., but a cheap pair of ear plugs solves that problem.

Less than half a block away from the Convention Center, and with 3 bedrooms and two baths, we had plenty of room for all of us. The added bonus of an area for all of us to gather and talk about what we had done at the convention. The cost savings compared to several hotel rooms was wonderful, especially with two parking spaces included in a gated area. Within walking distance were many restaurants and other things to do. I highly recommend Cafe Crepe, Downtown Burger and Ropollo's Pizza! Would definitely stay again next year for the same conference!

Also, for some reason, there was construction going on at 6:45AM on Saturday morning! Bring ear plugs, just in case. Definitely within walking distance of LOTS of great bars, restaurants, and shops - although having the 2 parking spaces in a private lot that could only be accessed with a key fob was really nice.

Downtown offered great breakfast at Joe's and wrapping up the days with live music at the Elephant Room - all walking distance. We enjoyed the gated security, finding it easy to come & go from the unit. The unit itself was clean and adequately equipped, and the rental management staff was VERY accommodating! Also, we were able to take the $1 Airport Metro just about to the front door, we did not rent a car, and had no problem seeing and doing everything we desired.

We felt that the condo was exactly as advertised and there were no surprises when we arrived. It was clean and ready for us.

Two minor complaints:

-The friend who stayed in the bedroom that faces the street said she had a tough time sleeping due to the noise (traffic, people walking home from bars, etc). Those of us in the other two bedrooms didn't hear that, but it's something to consider when figuring out who is sleeping where.

-On Friday night the girls next door came home late and stayed outside smoking and talking until the wee hours of the morning. We left them a note the next evening expaining that we needed our rest because we were running the marathon and they were very quiet and respectful that next night (which we greatly appreciated!)

WAY better than staying in a hotel! We were in Austin for a family wedding and our extended family was jealous of our accomodations.... We loved the way we could choose to gather together - so wonderful since we live in separate cities.

DO STAY HERE if you like historic, beautiful, excellent places to gather as a group - both inside and outside. There are so many places to gather - it was a family joke - do we want to sit in the back yard? the side yard? off the kitchen (before/after/during breakfast), the living room? or somewhere else...

I enjoyed the tub.. what a luxury to have a claw-foot tub.

The bedrooms all provide privacy - and good storage. The upstairs bedroom does have the bath downstairs - not a problem - but don't expect this to be 'laid out like a hotel room'. And one of the 3 baths does not have a shower - so we did coordinate a bit - but that was a very minor inconvenience. The 'master bath' was a bit small - but entirely adequate.

Each room was special with various seating arrangements, and we used them all. We loved the 30s feel of the house, with built in bookcases and wardrobes, enhanced by beautiful antique rugs. The owners have done a wonderful job of updating kitchens and baths without sacrificing historical detail and the arts and craft feeling throughout the house. The all equipped kitchen was convenient, (only a blender was missing, but they did have a cocktail shaker). Although it is an old house, each room has multiple windows, as well as two cozy sunrooms, letting in loads of light.

The property, unusual for Austin, had enormous lush trees and bushes with flowers surrounding the house, multiple sitting areas, and distance from surrounding properties.

We loved hearing the birds and seeing neighborhood dogs being walked nearly.

If you want a house with character and a true sense of place, this is the house for you!

It is a wonderful home and very well-maintained by the owners. It has plenty of space for four adult men and could certainly accommodate several families. The outdoor area is impressive and the size of lot provides quite a bit of privacy. The neighborhood is also great. It is a little bit of a walk to nearby restaurants and retail, but with a car you are very conveniently located to a lot of the city. I would highly recommend the Harris Park Guest House to anyone visiting Austin. And, I'm looking forward to returning on our next trip.

Its perfect for a few couples, a couple of families or even a group of guys (like us). 3 bedrooms & 3 baths means everyones happy and a full, functional kitchen helps a bunch too. There are several restaurants and cafes within a few blocks and downtown is a short bus ride away with two lines stopping within two blocks on either side of the house (#7 and #10 routes). UT is in easy walking distance. The neighborhood is super quiet (theres a seminary next door!) and theres a nice park down at the end of the street. Price is great year-round though F1 week gets kinda pricey (still worth it though:-). Owners are great and responsive, we've stayed twice now and never had a problem. A wonderful and comfortable place that I hope to stay in again, thanks Ann and Jay :-)

The only downside is that you have to park around the corner on the street and walk to (and up) the drive and steep steps to reach the apartment - a little inconvenient, but outweighed by the pleasant apartment and surroundings.

We asked for an extra blanket (before finding the Nest dial) and he delivered right away. I would totally recommend this place and plan on staying again if I go back to Austin.

For what I researched, the studio is one of the best values in Austin -- it was impeccably stocked, incredibly clean and beautifully decorated. The back patio was awesome...a perfect secluded spot surrounded by tall bamboo -- all of the gardens were amazing. Todd and Amy were super helpful and attentive, giving us many suggestions for things to do and local flair to check out. The off-street parking initially worried me, but this is one of the nicest neighborhoods in town and we felt very safe with our rental car on the street.

As for Austin as a vacation destination, we could not say enough about it...many of our friends in Boston said, what are you going to do there for two weeks??? Honestly, we didn't want to leave! Between the food (amazing options...I think I could eat a Torchy taco every day of my life), the music scene, the overall vibe (I couldn't believe how Green it was...not what I was expecting for Texas), the and the golf (Falconhead and Teravista were our favs!)...it was a perfect, relaxing get away.

They where soo friendly to me as complete strangers- to go over every detail I immediately felt welcome and comfortable. Seeing the cozy apartment first hand - I was sooo happy! Knew it was a perfect fit for me -from the cleanliness to the comfy bed, fully equipped kitchen and open/bright atmosphere- I knew I wouldn’t be home sick at all! -it just felt right :) During my stay they were more than accommodating in helping my directionally challenged self lol -giving me maps to literally driving to meet me while lost and leading me back...felt totally safe and taken care of! my trip was overall so refreshing I could have stayed longer and can't wait to go back! Looking to getaway for business or pleasure -alone or with someone else I would definitely stay here! Best Experience!! Thank you soo much Amy and Todd shall our paths cross again :) Be well, Lindy

The studio apartment was clean, comfortable, modern, and private. Loved the little private patio in the back, and the WiFi was a must for a business trip. Parking could be an issue, but the studio is well-suited for those who like to walk. A walk over the I-35 bridge gets you into downtown Austin with it's many and diverse activities. I totally recommend walking/running/biking the Town Lake Trail.

I appreciated Todd and Amy's hospitality and helpfulness. Due to weather related issues, my flights were very delayed and I spent an entire day on planes and tarmac, getting in after midnight. Amy was very understanding and even prepared a fruit and cheese plate for me knowing that I had not been able to eat all day.

I would definitely recommend the Riverside Gem to a single person on a pleasure or business trip or a couple wanting to explore Austin's diverse activities. It's a welcome ""home"" away from home while exploring all Austin has to offer. Accommodations are comfortable, and the place feels very safe and secure.

Amy and Todd were two of the most accommodating property owners we have encountered. From Amy's immediate response to my email inquiry and the convenient payment through PayPal, to the warm welcome we received upon arrival, we feel the process couldn't have been any smoother. The apartment is spotless, comfortable and modern, with every amenity we could possibly want. The bathroom was even stocked with lotion, sunscreen, soap and shampoo. Since the apartment was so conveniently located in the middle of the city, there was some traffic noise at night, but it was nothing our ear plugs couldn't easily resolve. We will definitely stay with Todd & Amy during our next visit to Austin and highly recommend it for other couples or small families.

Located in probably one of the most eclectic and charming Austin neighborhoods, Travis Heights, this Garage apartment was my home for 2 months from January 4th till March 1st of this year ... 2010. I needed a place that was very close to my Daughters apartment on East Riverside Drive so I could walk to her Condo each day to see my brand new Grandson who was born in Dec of 2009. Not only could I walk to her home in the Riverwalk Condos on Ladybird Lake, I had direct access to the Austin Hike and Bike Trail which runs directly across the street from the Apartment making it such a wonderful way to greet each day. Not only could I get in a really good walk, I could then just follow the trail right to my Daughters door. There's a small convenience store within walking distance, a Sub Shop, Coffee house for a great cup of morning coffee, and my most favorite place on earth ... WHOLE FOODS!! is just up the road along with everything you could want to do or see in Downtown Austin. Amy and Todd are wonderful hosts and everything you could possibly need is provided for you. Their own home has an Old World German feel to it complete with stone terraced gardens and your very own private stone deck on the back of the Apartment to sit outside and enjoy the Austin sunshine. I'm truly torn about telling everyone just how lovely it is ... then everyone will want it and I'll never get to stay there anymore when I visit my Family!!

Thank you Amy and Todd for making my stay in Austin such a pleasure.

The apartment gives you easy access to South Congress, Barton Springs/Zilker Park, downtown and the University....but also allows you to come home to a quiet and relaxing place to rest. The owners are extremely nice and accommodating. If you are interested, they are happy to help you pick a restaurant, navigate the city or just chat, but they are also respectful of your privacy. All in all I could not have asked for a better place to stay...great apartment, great location, very cool owners, and fair price.

It is perfectly located, close to downtown, sixth street, the capitol, the trail next to the river, restaurants and grocery stores. We loved the deck and grilled out one of the evenings. The house was fully air conditioned, which was extremely necessary during the 95-100 degree days. The beds were comfortable, and there was plenty of space for the four of us. This was one of my favorite vacations, this house will be a part of some of my favorite memories spent in Austin. I highly recommend this cottage.

461,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p235658vb#reviews,"Jun 8, 2016",3/5,The good and bad.........,"As a long time VRBO user, I always look at reviews before securing a property. I was a bit reluctant to settle on this one since it had only one current review. So here are my thoughts:

PROS: Location is excellent. Close and walkable to many of Austin's things to do. Neighborhood was safe and quiet. Interior of the house was clean and well stocked. Beds and linens were excellent ! Lots of little extras were provided for an enjoyable trip.

CONS: Exterior of the house was run down. Back yard was completely unusable as it was one giant overgrown weed. We wouldn't even let our child go out there. Decks and exterior of house need some attention. Grill was provided but unusable as the grates were covered in mold. Trash cans outside were overflowing with trash that appeared to have been there for weeks. Kitchen utensils were plentiful but could definitely use updating. Had to cook breakfast in a very undesirable skillet.

Owner Caroline was very difficult to communicate with. I became increasingly concerned about the entire rental process and up until two days before the rental began was never comfortable with the situation. I was scrambling to find a back up hotel in the event the owner didn't cooperate. I have never had such a negative experience with an owner and communication in my past VRBO dealings.

The house is beautifully appointed with a great kitchen and wonderful deck--perfect for hanging out with friends or family. The neighborhood is lovely and within walking distance of a number of fun bars and restaurants. You are just down the road from an amazing Whole Foods grocery store and you are a very short drive from downtown and the world famous Austin music scene. The house is perfectly situated for day trips to Lake Travis and the hill country. I would definitely stay here again the next time I visit.

It's clean, cute and has everything you need. The outside deck is a great place to eat and drink outside with friends. It is just down the street from the Whole Foods and the kitchen is well equipped which makes preparing food easy and helps save money while on vacation. The owner was extremely helpful and sweet in answering any questions we had about the house (for example, discovering they had bikes on site for our use and the combination to them), as well as questions about the city itself (for example, where the best place to buy cowboy boots was). I would highly recommend renting this lovely house if you are traveling to Austin any time soon.

It was perfect for our needs - ""Austin cool""! The location could not be beat - walking distance to Whole Foods, close to the trails at Lady Bird Lake, easy access to MoPac. The neighborhood is very eclectic and several local coffee shops within walking distance. There was the construction going on, on both sides, but in most neighborhoods in Austin you can't hardly get away from that. I worked from the house 8 hours a day and was not bothered by the noise though. And, one of the houses is almost complete. The beds were very comfortable, and the kitchen has modern appliances. We enjoyed the deck almost daily. If ever going back to Austin, we would want to stay here!

Both neighbors are doing MAJOR renovations to their houses so it can get quite noisy during the day! If you have children that need to nap during the day or are looking for a quiet place to unwind this is definitely something to be aware of. I wish that I had know this in advance.

This is a great little bungalow. Clean, well-equipped with a large backyard, patio and big gas grill for outdoor living. The location cannot be beat. Shopping, entertainment, restaurants and clubs within walking distance and extremely convenient freeway access for trips to outlying areas.

But the very best thing about this house are the owners. My husband and I have been traveling around for many months, staying in other vacation homes (including the Austin area), and Caroline proved to be much easier to work with than almost all property owners we've dealt with. She's fair, responsive and proactive with her renters and her property. Your vacation and Austin is yours to experience, and yet if you need a resource she can direct you to it.

Highly recommended as one of the best rental values in Clarksville and downtown Austin.

Even though it rained everyday it would stop long enough to use the canoe and go explore. The upper deck of the dock was wonderful in the morning or the evening (our favorite) just sitting and taking in the greenery. The kitchen had everything you need to cook and there is a gas BBQ too. Note: there is a Randall's grocery store at the corner of Quinlan Park Road and the 620. It was a nice treat having a washer and dryer to wash and dry your wet items after coming in from the river. David has quite the collection of cd's making it super easy to keep the TV off. The couple times we contacted David he responded very quickly. If you stay while school is in session please note not to plan on leaving the house when the schools are starting or getting out.

This home is absolutely perfect! It had everything we needed and more. I have been to plenty of lake homes and this was the absolute best. It had a great dock area, super easy access into the late with stairs. It had all the water toys you could imagine and plenty of bath towels to go around. The kitchen had everything we needed for cooking meals during our stay and the beds were very comfortable. The view from the kitchen while eating was breath taking. And the backyard was perfect for the dog! I have never seen him have more fun zooming around that huge yard! It is fenced on all three sides and bordered by dock and lake on the fourth side. We also found a fishing pole in the shed and some floats! Which was the super fun. The hot tub just adds to the charm and fun during your vacation.

We spent our weekend outside! We went paddle boarding, kayaking, canoeing and even took the killer whale float for a ride! The overlook on the dock is so amazing it felt like a movie.

And if everything was not already perfect enough, we also got visited by swans everyday we were there!

OH and let me tell you, the host is amazing! We scheduled a fishing guide trip that would make us late checking out and the David worked with us through all of that! AND he was so helpful whenever I left stuff at the vacation home. We thought it was lost and they kept looking for it and found it :)

Thank you so much for this great stay! And thank you so much for helping me with my lost gopro! We will be back in a few weeks :)

The beds are comfortable, but by the end of a good day you sort of fall in and pass out anyway. Kitchen pots and pans are fine for a good breakfast before heading out, as well as preparing other meals. The back deck is wonderful for relaxing, reading; just nice to be outside on a beautiful Fall morning. We didn't use any of the plentiful watercraft, but the boat dock and deck terrific! have a nice glass of wine and sit and watch the water!

There are good restaurants close by and a large HEB for groceries, which make things very convenient. We had massages at the Lake Austin Spa and Resort. It was pricey as one would expect of a facility comparable to Canyon Ranch. Heavenly!!

There's a good selection of DVD movies and an amazing assortment CDs. Just great music. I would guess that the owner was born somewhere between 1945 and 1955? So much of the music I would have for my own home. You had me at little Feat!!!

My daughter and I will be back!

There were a few little things that could be corrected but it was perfect for us. Clean, well stocked, beautiful, good beds, fantastic shower and the water access, hot tub, kayaks, canoe, SUPs were all used at least once, pushing my comfort zone on my 71st Birthday but making me feel like a kid again and that I really need to keep having fun and that I still can. One of my favorite things is that there were no houses across the lake and having our tea/coffee out on the dock and then meditating was the absolute best way to start the day. Thank you, thank you!

It is located on the beautiful and chilly Lake Austin just a few doors down from the Lake Austin Spa and Resort. I recommend staying during the week if you are looking for calm mornings and quiet down-time. This lake gets very busy with boats and people blasting loud music on weekends. The house was well appointed with ample linens, towels, toilet paper, etc. However, if you are a foodie and enjoy cooking, bring your own spatulas, spices, hot sauces and nicer kitchen wares with you. Don't bother hauling food from home...there is a very nice grocery store just up the road. If you enjoy fishing, bring your fishing gear, as there is everything you need for water play fun; kayaks, canoes, SUP boards, pool noodles, etc., but no fishing gear. This is Texas, so also pack the mosquito spray. We look forward to returning in the future, especially now that we know what to bring. My only big complaint was that housekeeping may be disgruntled, as the floors hadn't been mopped in a while and flooring under beds, couches, needed vacuuming. If I could have found a mop or vacuum...I would have tackled it myself. The location is WONDEFUL and you will surely enjoy your time here.

It boasted the best bathroom of any of our prior rental stays with plenty of towels and wonderful counter space. We especially applaud the lovely titled step-in shower (with skylight).

The deck above the boat slips was a fun place to watch the entertaining parade of every type of watercraft. The house is across the river from a bird sanctuary with absolutely no development. The house is in a neighborhood with normal neighborhood noise (lawnmowers, construction, happy children, weed eaters, etc.). Also, the owners of the boats housed in the boat slips do have access to their boats and they come and go onto the property via an access gate near the boat slip. Our biggest treat was watching an adult and three juvenile Eastern screech owls as they hunted the lovely back yard. Our kudos to David, Rachel, and Christie who were all super to work with. We recommend a stay.

The house and amenities were comfortable and fun and the setting was beautiful. We spent three nights here with our two Border Collies and family. All went well and exceeded our expectations. The boat dock and water toys made the experience perfect for us. We easily launched our old ski boat at the ramp just next the property and there was adequate parking for our boat trailer and two vehicles at the house. Rachel was available for any questions and concerns and the instructions and information provided at the house were complete and helpful. Thank you for a great experience!

The house was just what was needed. We made the short 15 minute drive to Steiner Ranch Steakhouse for a great dinner the first night. It was an easy and enjoyable trip to downtown Austin. Back at the house, while we didn't have any luck catching any fish (bad weather), we all enjoyed our peaceful time in the backyard.

Hubby and I wanted a place to celebrate our anniversary for two nights. We wanted a hot tub, fireplace, and a dock to fish off of. The house had everything we needed. I do recommend you bring paper towels and coffee filters. There were plenty of cooking supplies and towels. The shower at first was not hot but after a call to the property manager, that was taken care the next morning. Lakeside Pizza and Grill is a perfect spot to grab a bite to eat and there's a place called Hula Hut that backs up to the river for spectacular views and homemade tortillas. I would have given 5 stars but the house could use a little updates on furniture(not super comfortable) and carpet might need to be ripped out in bedrooms. Just a little wear from usage. Nothing that would keep me from coming back or staying there again.

We enjoyed cooking out on the grill, hanging on the deck and relaxing in the hot tub both nights! The backyard is breath taking. From the soft, green grass that we were able to play frisbee bare foot, the swings hanging from trees, the water floats, the kayaks, canoe, and fishing gear!! We caught fish right from the dock! We spent most of our time (when not in the water) outside on the two story dock. We napped on the hammock and enjoyed lounging in the shade on both levels of the dock all day! We rented a boat, went skiing and wake boarding and had no issue driving the boat right up to the dock. We were blown away with everything that this house had to offer!

That is where we spent most of our time, watching boaters and just enjoying the view. The carport is right next to the kitchen; so unloading was very easy. Everything we needed was in the kitchen. Nice refrigerator with water/ice in the door. Beds were comfortable, everything was clean and tidy. Plenty of room in the closets and extra bedding. The shower was wonderful: large, beautiful tile, and two shower heads. The washer/dryer looks new, and it was nice coming home with very little laundry to do. There is a large grocery store on the road going to and from the main highway; so very convenient. I was a little concerned about parking, because two of our sons were driving to the house to visit, along with our car. Not to worry. The carport was large enough for our Ford Expedition Extended, and behind us there was room for two mid-sized cars side by side without encroaching onto the yard. The owner and manager were extremely easy to deal with, fast response, with our comfort foremost in their minds. Definitely will go back to this lake house.

The pictures of this house are deceiving. While they are not exactly false and there are good features - the beds were comfortable enough and there were plenty of supplies in the kitchen, our stay was disappointing. The house is a very old house in a very old neighborhood and needs a lot of work on the outside as well as a lot of improvements on the inside. The ice maker is slow, the lighting is inadequate, the sliding door to the deck needs a new track, the ""carpeting"" on the deck over the water is torn up and peeling, the toilet seat was lose, lots of stuff in the kitchen but kind of beat up. We went for a quiet weekend, but endured two parties of lots of people on either side of us from Friday night to Sunday afternoon, music included. There is a ramp running down the side of the property that seems to be open to everybody - boat launchers, dog walkers, fishermen. I feel this house is overpriced for the quality.

We took advantage of the amenities including fishing from the boat dock (caught some nice bass) to hot tubbing with a glass of wine after long days of boating on the lake. We were able to easily launch our boat and tie up to the dock for our use during our stay. Everyone in our group raved about the weekend and our accommodations. I was pleased, particularly since I live in Austin and was responsible for planning the weekend for myself and my guests who traveled to Austin and ranged in age.

Felt like we'd come home to ""our"" house and it was good to be back. We didn't fish, but people were catching them like crazy and we saw some big ones swimming/jumping at end of dock. The hydrilla problem is under control thanks to the introduction of the grass-eating carp so no more worry about clogging your intake/propeller. We went from one end of the lake to the other and it was great. As always, the house is cozy and just right ... private, quiet area, low boat traffic, beautiful scenery, totally restful ... even had a cool breeze during our sunset cruises. Hard to beat that first cup of coffee on the porch watching the water! And, importantly, Randalls and good restaurants (try Steiner Ranch Steak House) are just minutes away. We come to be at the house and the water, but there's plenty to do in the surrounding area and for those into physical abuse, a kayak and canoe!

Wine and cheese on the deck shaded by a big tree over the boat house looking at the water and the hills across the water? Priceless! Even the blasted hydrilla wasn't that big an issue for us (thanks to all those July 4th folks who chopped it up). Randalls is just down the road, but a stay here is going back to another time, another place, and that's just what we were looking for. OOOhhhh, and there are big fish to be had for those who might want to wet a line! Only bad thing was discovering how fabulous a 4'x7' shower is! Husband is in trouble now! :)))

All the coordinating and emailing was very attentive and quick, plus they're very good with paperwork and giving you all the information you need upfront. I only called once to make sure I had the right place, it's to the left of the boat ramp and privately tucked away. The kitchen, living rooms and bedrooms were all spotless and stocked with essentials ... even the kitchen has just about everything you probably forgot at home (like a small amount of cooking spray, spices, coffee, blender, extra cooler, etc). The television is much larger than the one in the photo (about a 37"" or 42"" flat screen), cable/internet/water/sony sound systems all functional. The daybeds in the rooms are not easily moveable, so I wouldn't recommend bringing more than 6 people if sleep privacy is a concern. We brought our Xbox and played every morning with no issues. The temp got down to about 50 degrees, and We were able to build a nice fire in the fireplace, and enjoy the hot tub (all 6 of us managed to sit comfortably with a minimal amount of footsy). But the PATIO and the DOCK are to die for. There are plenty of chairs on the upper deck, a hammock, and tons of privacy and shade from the trees above. A speed boat or fishing boat would sail by about twice every half hour...very quiet waters. It was worth every penny to be ON the lake. Also, the lake was pretty full...I was nervous about low water levels, but definitely not the case when we went! The kayaks and canoe were fun and my little dog was completely secure, leashlessly roaming around the huge back yard. I kind of wish the Bluffs/UT Golf center would've put a Walgreens closer (5 min to the nearest gas station, 10 min to the Randalls, and Walgreens), but other than that...this lakehouse is a slice of hill country heaven!!

I'm definitely coming back...my boyfriend proposed to me on that dock!! :D

We spent most of our time outside enjoying the boat dock/upper deck and the peaceful view of the Golden Cheeked-Warbler habitat directly across the lake. The owner has thought of everything! You just need to bring food and clothing, practically everything else is provided. We kayaked, canoed, floated on the blow-up floats, played soccer and baseball in the large, well shaded yard and had a hot tub if we wanted. With the owner's permission, we were allowed to bring our dogs, who had as much fun as we did. The house is clean, tastefully decorated, has a well-equipped kitchen, wireless internet (had to do a little work), games, stereo for our ipod, washer and dryer, and plenty of linens. We will definitely return!

Beautiful views and a great deck to sit on as the sun sets. The fully stocked kitchen was a great plus, and the quaint surroundings provided a nice ambience. We enjoyed the canoe as well.

Me and my wifes family stayed for a week at this location. There was 6 people. Eventhough it only had one bathroom and two bedrooms it was plenty of space. Everyone had a bed to sleep on with one to spare. The lake front is amazing. The view all day and night is perfect. Because it is a little up the lake there are very few boats going back and forth which made it very peaceful. The house was equiped with everything needed. We love to cook, the big kitchen and big grill were definately put to work. PERFECT vacation!!!

"
547,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p243133#reviews,"Apr 26, 2010",5/5,Ski Weekend,"Our stay at the lakehouse was perfect for our boating weekend. The location of the house is on upper Lake Austin—one of the more secluded and beautiful parts of the lake. The large, shaded back yard provided a great place to toss the frisbee and football. The boat dock was very convenient for quick access to the water for ski runs. The house was also very convenient for quick access to the Mansfield Dam and Lakeway area for restaurants.

"
548,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p243133#reviews,"Apr 13, 2010",4/5,Great lakefront Location!,"This vacation home is smallish but appointed with modern amenities and everything a couple or family might need. The standout feature is the lakefront location. The yard is large and the lake view serene, especially in the morning before the boating crowd gets going.

We stayed at the house for two nights during rather cool spring weather, so didn't take advantage of the kayaking, swimming and other outdoor features the home offers during the warmer seasons. (Probably avoided some of the noisy summer crowds as well!) There is a boat launch location right next door so there was some activity coming and going, but not enough to be distracting during our visit.

We did enjoy having our breakfasts and evening meals on the upper deck, and appreciated the scenic ""wilderness"" of the opposite shore, far more peaceful than a Lake Travis location might offer. It is worth noting that it is about a half hour drive to Austin, so don't plan to jump back and forth between the locations. There are local restaurants and services, however.

 Overall, we enjoyed our stay very much.

Also, the community pool was very nice and having access to it was a big plus. There's a great walking/running trail around the community and tennis courts near by in case it's not too hot to take advantage of them! The landlords are great and were very helpful with suggestions for local things to do (restaurants, bars, etc.). If you want the convenience of having a kitchen, the one in the apartment is pretty nice and has most of what you need for some good cooking. There is a parking spot right next to the entrance off the street. Overall, very nice, new, modern apartment that definitel beats a hotel stay.

And when we had a catastrophe with our car, he was very understanding and accommodating, letting us check out late while we got things sorted out.

The place: just the perfect size for a brief stay for two or longer for one. Nicely decorated and outfitted with everything you need. He even has a binder setup with maps to all the places you might need in the area like grocery stores. Off street parking if you have a compact, snug for a full size.

The area: beautiful park across the street and Cherrywood Cafe is a brief 15mins walk to get some food, coffee or adult beverage. Close to 35 for quick access to wherever you need to get too.

It was very clean, nicely decorated, and very private even though the owners live next door. How nice to have them available to answer questions! They were very welcoming and helpful. Thankfully a few small staples were provided in the kitchen (Margarine, sugar, coffee, tea, jam, etc) to get me started. The apartment seemed larger then the impression given by the photos and has a nice walk in closet on the second floor for storage. I enjoyed the fast screen TV's on each floor. The tree branches from the second floor window made the bedroom seem exotic even in winter. Leave the shades open at night for a beautiful night time effect and spectacular sunrise experience. No wonder it is called a treehouse. It is also lovely to sit under the tree on the private patio and enjoy the back yard.

 Getting around Austin from this apt was not difficult, but I would say that one definitely needs a car to get to the local sites and shopping. Walking everywhere would be unfeasible. It is in a pleasant residential neighborhood but not close enough to stay without personal transportation.

TVs with cable both up and down. The kitchen is well appointed, with all appliances and supplies, including unbelievable plates, bowls and mugs hand made by Stan. Take a moment and visit him in his workshop out back. It is so interesting to see a professional potter in his element. Vicki made herself available for any questions or concerns, and gave us a large list and directions to local eateries and grocery stores. She even invited us to an intimate musical performance in their home, and the local 4th of July festivities during our stay. We could not have asked for kinder hosts.

The property is located within walking distance of Barton Springs, Zilcher Park, Lady Bird Lake, and South Lamar. It is a short drive to the UT campus, and a shorter drive to downtown or the St. Edwards campus.

We stayed for a month with our 11 yr. old son and enjoyed everything from the back yard swing, sitting outside on the patio drinking coffee in the morning, the cats, strolling down to Barton Springs for a swim, walking the trail around Lady Bird Lake, shopping and munching at a fabulous Whole Foods and visiting the Bob Bullock Texas History Museum.

It was close to all the action, but removed enough to escape the chaos of sxsw and 6th street.

The place itself had all the amenities you could possibly need, right down to the ever essential first few mornings of coffee and cream! It was very clean, modern, and well maintained.

Our hosts were amazing! They went above and beyond to make sure that we were comfortable and with the necessary information to make the most out of our stay. From providing hand-drawn maps (which are a big help in those windy side streets!) and answering our ridiculous tourist questions, to providing us with tons of ideas of activities and sights worth checking out. Austin is easily one of the greatest cities I have ever been to, and part of that is due to the wonderful people that call it home. Vicki and Stan were no exception.

We negotiated our way to the LBJ Library, the UT campus, the artsy SoCo shopping district, and various art museums and gallerys without difficulty. In addition, we ate everything from delish fried shrimp & avocado tortilla wraps at The Mighty Cone (served from an Airstream trailer) to high end memorable Japanese cuisine at Ushi (located within a mile of the Annex). Tex Mex too, of course. The Annex is simple, but solid and is clean, quiet and thoughtfully appointed. Having a full sized refrigerator and stove/oven made carryout from the Whole Foods flagship and the Central Market easy to prepare when we stayed in. A couple of the chairs could use updating, but that is a very minor comment -- overall the property is just as pictured and is located in a safe residential neighborhood. As others have mentioned, Vicki and Stan could not be more gracious hosts. They provided us with a booklet of maps and tips for enjoying the city, and were more than happy to answer our questions and make recommendations when asked. We enjoyed meeting them.

Vicki and Stan were very helpful and friendly and their place was very well kept. Stan's pottery was beautiful, and a lovely addition to the overall decor.

We didn't have a car for the duration of our stay, but were able to easily get around on foot. Walking through Zilker Park to get downtown is definitely recommended. Walking down Lamar wasn't nearly as beautiful, though we did discover some AMAZING food carts (i.e. Texas Cuban and Gordough's Donuts). A cab ride from downtown to the apartment was also only about $10, and public transportation was cheap and easy to use as well.

The back yard was beautiful, and we took full advantage of the hot tub and bbq. The only thing that was a little lacking was the amount of condiments available. We were hoping to do lots of cooking, but there were only a few spices and a tiny bit of olive oil. Definitely not a big deal, we just weren't expecting to have to buy ketchup,mustard, oil, etc. Also, Vicki and Stan were so nice, I'm sure they would have let us borrow anything if we had asked.

Overall, great experience and we'd love to come back some time!!

I lived there for a number of years and was therefore familiar with the city. But had I not been Vicki and Stan thought of everything I would have needed to navigate Austin.

We had a truly wonderful stay! Whether walking to Zilker and around the neighborhood or relaxing in the open floor plan or on the patio it could not have been more peaceful. We were pleased with the proximity to everything we needed, and this certainly felt like a true home base for our stay. Everything we needed was in the house and the open floor plan made it seem like we were in much larger accomodations. This was a truly unique experience for us.

We plan to make this our ""home"" for all future trips to Austin. We purchased some of Stan's pottery before we left as well.

I would certainly recommend this to others...unless your trip happens to coincide with mine!

Looking at our hotel options, I wasn't very jazzed. I happened upon Homeaway and saw this apartment. For the price and location, I thought it was an excellent deal. We've rented apartments on previous trips to Europe, but didn't know this option was common stateside. I sent the request and quickly received a phone call from Vicki. I secured the reservation and received lots of information from her beforehand.

We immediately fell in love with the apartment. It far surpassed our expectations, which is not always the case with website photos. The apartment addition is brand new, beautifully designed, and full of small extras that made the stay fantastic. The quality of the building was evident in the materials used (concrete, stone, solid wood) and how solid everything felt. You can tell a lot of care and attention went into creating this space.

I also loved all of the little extras throughout the apartment. From the beautiful ceramic pieces (dishes and decorative) created by one of the owners to the books, games, and movies, each detail made it feel like a home.

They have created a specialized guide book for the apartment and area, including a walking map. Although it was too hot for us to do so, you can walk to many fabulous places from the apartment.

The apartment is full of windows that overlook the beautiful property. I love how the windows crank open; in the fall or spring it would be lovely to sleep with the windows open and hear the sound of surrounding nature.

The bathroom was also fantastic. The water pressure was good, and it had plenty of towels and mini hotel toiletries.

We definitely recommend the Cistern House Annex for a unique, comfortable, affordable stay in Austin.

The pottery throughout the house was made by Stan, the owner, and it is really beautiful. Speaking of the owners, Vicki and Stan are wonderful to work with and even provided a binder full of information about the house and a walking map of the area. We took the walking map everywhere we went and discovered The Pie Slice, The Alamo Drafthouse, and Barton Springs, just to name a few local treasures. Each little trip was a great surprise and a great walk!

My husband and I stayed for a full week and it was a wonderful week of rest and relaxation. We highly recommend the Cistern House if you are looking for a quiet neighborhood with lots do. As far as the hosts, I can't remember staying anywhere with such wonderful hosts as Vicki and Stan!

The House is an easy access close to Bee Cave in a confortable style from the 70s. The stone exterior is particularly striking.

The large main room is the main attraction with its comfortable space and high windows looking toward the river/lake.

The bedrooms are well appointed. Beds fairly comfortable albeit a bit noisy sometimes for those beds with metal springs.

AC works well in the middle bedrooms and downstairs but not so much in the master bedroom. The half bath downstairs and the toilet in the master bath are in very small spaces so somewhat of a squeeze. Also, the bowl in the master would find some advantage in being better fastened to the floor as it moves a bit.

We did not have a boat ourselves but we can see a really enormous advantage for those with a boat, given the boat lift.

One attraction for us was the swimming in the lake. The boat lift/deck provide access to the river/lake. A drawback that we discovered is that the lake is very cold. A lot of river detritus and trash seem to accumulate in the area around the dock, which was less nice for swimming.

Some construction work on the nextdoor houses did wake us early a few mornings (7:30) but wasn't too bad overall.

One point that was memorable was the toaster that plays the Winnie-The-Pooh theme each time that the toast popped up. Winne-the-Pooh was our constant breakfast companion.

Overall a good confortable stay in a nice, honest-to-goodness lake house.

There is a very sharp U-turn to get to the house and if you have problems backing a trailer, be prepared, it is doable. When leaving there is plenty of room to make the right turn (although it seems like you might not make it).

My boyfriend's folks live in the same neighborhood as this rental home -- please be aware that this neighborhood is about 30 minutes from downtown Austin and is 100% residential. There are no street lights and some of the house numbers / street names are really difficult to read when traveling/driving at night. My folks got lost two or three times the first day or two, but then found their way around pretty easily. Again, it was perfect for us, location wise, because most of the get-togethers were at my bf's parents' place, which was less than a mile away.

The house: from what I could tell, it was really well stocked. Condiments in the fridge and shampoo/conditioner items in the bathrooms. Mark, the owner, also left us some fresh, homemade banana bread for the arrival and my folks raved about it. I'm pretty sure it was gone in 24 hours. The house is pretty much out of the nineties / early 2000s and you can tell it's primarily a rental home. There's a funky half bath with mirrors on the ceiling and the toaster plays disney music when the toast is finished (which is hilarious...but when you're trying to be quiet in the morning, it's a little difficult).

The layout is also a bit funky, but it works for people who are related. The master bedroom is a loft and overlooks the living area. There's a good private bedroom with a queen bed and a little bathroom off of it. Then the third bedroom had two twins and I suppose that bedroom can either share the bathroom in the master loft (which requires walking through the loft to get to) or the little bathroom down a small flight of stairs, which would be shared with the other private bedroom. Again, funky. But it works. It would be tough, I think, for multiple people who are not related or close.

The lake: is awesome. We were there in the winter, but the lake is one of the best waterskiing / wakeboarding lakes around Austin. (PS. It's not a real lake, but Austin decided to dam up parts of the Colorado river to make ""lakes"" and calls them all such, even though it's technically a river). ANYWAYS, the lake is sweet. I can see how the house would be awesome in the summer time for those with boats. There's also a nice little deck area on top of the boat dock so you can really get on top of the water.

Will definitely keep in mind for future family get-togethers.

We had a beautiful Waffle Bar Brunch on the balcony overlooking the lake. We were ""off the beaten path"" enough to feel like it was our own retreat. The drive back to town was not a quick one, so I would recommend having everything you need upon arrival to take advantage of the seclusion. Mark was wonderful to work with and I would absolutely stay here again (maybe in the summer time and take advantage of the boat dock). I would also recommend this property to anyone looking for a relaxing Lake Austin experience.

Nice, fenced back yard with new fire pit, though we did not use it. Katherine was very helpful and responsive, right from the start.

Always on top of communications and easy to reach though we didn't need to. The home is very comfortable and cozy inside. We travelled with our two kids so the two bedrooms were ample space for us. We appreciated the coolness upon our arrival in very hot late July. The whole home was very clean and smelled good when we walked in each time. The shower was strong and never ran out of hot water -- which was important since we four took several showers a day due to the extremely hot weather! The beds were both comfortable. I always go for a place that has at least one king size bed. The third bedroom is set up as an office with a couch and media center. I guess that couch unfolds to a bed to sleep two more. Note that this is only accessible through the master bedroom. Great for kids staying in there but not for another couple. The kitchen was well stocked, easy to heat up food in and had a wonderful backyard view from the dining table. I thought the cost was better than other places I viewed in the same area.

The neighborhood is swoon-worthy for sure. The home itself is cozy, with enough space for everyone.

The home was bright and clean with sufficient linens and towels for all. The owner, Colette delivered on all requests and checked in via email while we were there to make sure all was OK. The only issue was that the oven is quirky and small, and the casserole we prepared with the house dishes would not fit in the oven! The neighborhood was quiet, but close enough to ""downtown"" that several of us walked to the State Capitol and Whole Foods. Uber was convenient and easily accessible. Traffic was heavy and congested and we were glad that we did not have to do the driving. If a large group is traveling to Austin this is the perfect house.

There are plenty of common spaces [front living room, big kitchen island, den, sitting area in main hallway], and the bedrooms are well spread out in the house. There is plenty of closet space. The home was immaculately clean, and has enough room for several cars to park off the street.

Our only negatives about the house were these: First, two of the tubs did not have stoppers for the drains. We had allocated bedrooms according to who prefers to take baths, and it was a bit annoying to learn that two of those tubs weren't useable except as showers. Second, a couple of the rooms do not have overhead lighting, and the lamps were loaded with low-watt bulbs. This made visibility an issue. On top of that, in one of the rooms, one of the lamps' bulb was burned out. [Speaking of lighting - there are large panels with many switches in various spots in the house; it would be helpful if the switches were labelled as to which switch works outside lights, hall light, closet, whatever. This is a minor suggestion.]

Overall, we loved the house and would rent it again without hesitation. We were in Austin for a family wedding, and loved the location as well as the space and bedroom configuration. The landlord was attentive to requests in advance, which we appreciated.

Darn! We are a group of youngish (30-something) couples who were looking for the ideal location for walking to and from Zilker Park during the ACL music festival. This it about the spot best you can find for a large group of festivarians from out of town. But that is just the beginning of all the great Austin features this beautiful and unique home provides. Easily walk to Barton Springs pool via a nice little trail at the end of Linscomb. Step out onto the back deck in the morning and you can practically smell the coffee brewing and breakfast scrambling as the warm scents waft up the hill from the many sweet coffee houses and eateries down on Barton Springs Road. The ladies walked to SoCo for some shopping from the home. Another group walked downtown to a club and back for a late-night aftershow. And we made a trip or two to Thom's Market to stock up and cook our own meals in the spacious kitchen. Green Mesquite BBQ. Flipnotics Coffee. Barton Springs Bike Rentals. Chuy's! Everything you need or want is within a very short distance--walk, bike, bus, or if you must, taxi. That said, we were very reluctant to leave the house! The place is so seductive, you'll want to just lounge around on the hammock or deck or yoga room and listen to the birds. Perhaps most important, you will get a superb night's sleep in this very quiet neighborhood. We heard no complaints about the beds--all cozy. There are two great master suites here. I call dibs on the one upstairs for our next visit. Luxury! I only wish it could be for ACL 2011. Collette, thank you so much for your warm hospitality!

This house was perfect. There were enough bedrooms that everyone could have their own space and plenty of communal room between the living/dining/den. The outside deck and fireplace were perfect for late evening gatherings. It was also a perfect gathering spot for family dropping into town, those that wanted to park and walk down to the Zilker/Barton Springs area.

The house itself is fabulous. One of those gems that the pictures don't do justice. This isn't a rental house, it's a family's house that has been lovingly added onto throughout the years and still feels like it would be home if they lived there. The house was very clean upon arrival and everything was in good working order.

The owner is very friendly, very communicative, and lives in the same neighborhood. Any questions we had while searching, after signing a contract, or surrounding/during our stay were taken care of very quickly.

We would recommend this property over any other properties we've encountered. This house was one of the key items that made our wedding weekend as wonderful as it was.

We just had a bachelorette party here and I couldn't have asked for anything better! There were 13 of us, and we all slept comfortably! The indoor hot tub was definitely an added bonus to this wonderful house. The pictures don't do it justice. Every single one of the girls has asked me to plan another girls' weekend here for next summer! Colette was amazing to work with, and the cat did come around, but never tried to enter the house... We had zero hiccups throughout the weekend, and I would 100% recommend this house to any potential renters. Thank you so much Colette and God bless!!!!!

813,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p268686vb#reviews,"Aug 11, 2010",4/5,Very spacious house in great location. Perfect as long as you're not allergic to cats.,"This house was perfect for our girls' reunion in Austin. The huge floor plan gave all of eight of us plenty of space and there was never a wait for the bathrooms. We particularly enjoyed the master bathroom with its roomy shower and giant, gentle showerhead. The deck in the backyard was the perfect place to lounge before going to dinner, and the speaker system throughout the house made for a lively atmosphere (supplemented by the house's impressive CD collection from many genres). The description and photos posted here give an accurate depiction of the property.

In terms of location, the house is in a great location-a very safe neighborhood with lots of trees and a very natural feel, and there is plenty of space to park your cars. The house was within walking distance of Bartons Springs and also many delicious places to eat. (For future travelers, be sure to stop by Flip Happy Crepes, Odd Duck, and Gourdoughs-all three were delicious.)

There were only a few minor issues that prevented us from giving the house a 5-star review. We saw at least three cockroaches when we were there, but that's to be expected, given the climate and location of the house. More importantly was the issue of the cat. One of the girls started to become very congested upon arriving and exploring the house. Upon reading the instructions left by Colette, we discovered that a cat formerly occupied the house and although it now lives across the street, it still thinks it lives there. Well, this was a problem because three of the girls were severely allergic to cats (and one of those girls also has cystic fibrosis). We quickly had to grab some allergy medicine from a nearby drug store, but one of the girls still felt pretty crummy throughout the weekend when she was in the house. Additionally, the cat showed up and tried to enter the house once when we opened the front door. The instructions upon arriving at the house were the very first we had heard about the cat. Had we known previously about the cat, we probably would have chosen a different rental.

Other than these minor issues, Colette was very responsive and prompt in all communications and this house was a great find. I would highly recommend it for a large group that is traveling to Austin, as long as nobody has any cat allergies.

The pictures don't do justice to the home at all. Very large with a ""to die for"" master bed and bathroom, could just keep you in during your stay by itself. Perfect for a family, or for a couple of couples or for a guys or gals weekend, we much enjoyed the feel of the home, the layout, and the area. The neighborhood is really cool with mid century moderns and redone cottages, very safe - we took several walks and enjoyed the friendly neighbors. The great room was very cool for gathering the family up before dinner, and we all enjoyed the huge kitchen with the island. Colette has the place stocked well with movies and an amazing CD collection - and a really great stereo that can be played all over the house or in only the room you are in. Regarding Colette, she was a great hostess and we appreciated her timeliness and quickness to get back to us with any additional request. We will definitely be back.

Seven of us rented this house, and I daresay it was perfect for our week-long stay. Have you ever received an unexpected upgrade to a suite at an upscale hotel, and when you unlock the door and enter you automatically high-five your traveling companion? Well, magnify that feeling by ten, and that’s how our gang felt upon entering this rental – everyone scattered in various directions, ooh-ing and aah-ing. The fact that I found this on VRBO and made the booking has made me something of a hero amongst these friends, and when we parted ways at the end of the week, several of them insisted they want me to book all their vacations. I only wish there were homes of such quality, in such a desirable location, everywhere I travel.

But don't be surprised when you show up and the house is very small, quite old, and not exactly the luxury you'd expect from being in this neighborhood (or paying this price). It's simple and clean. But the couches are old and stained, the bathroom can fit one person max (and has no light), and there's no central AC. Which is fine as long as you know what to expect. And if you're new parents looking to sleep in, bring a mask and earplugs – the sun streams in through the old shades and yard guys were constantly around in the mornings. Overall a cute little place in a gorgeous area as long as you're aware of what you're in for. But we had a great, relaxing time and no major issues.

The use of the kayaks and water equipment and the deck on the lake was by far the best part. The cottage probably hasn't been touched since it was built. The plumbing and electric don't appear to be up to code. The couches are stained and old. It should not be listed to sleep 4 adults comfortably. It is very small. Cynthia and Jerry were very accommodating letting us check in early however did not refund our security deposit due to a missing strap that costs 10$.

Depending what the purpose of the trip is, this could be a great place for you. It is far from downtown over very curvy roads.

The kitchen was well stocked and everything was very clean. Plenty of storage space for suitcases. Plenty of towels, extra blankets, beach towels. The boat dock was nice. There's a huge table up there and 8-10 chairs. We didn't use the little fireplace. The only suggestion I would make is to invest in a new grill. A few of the metal grates are corroded through and the inside paint of the lid is peeling. Otherwise, a great little place for a few people. I would for sure rent it again.

The dock was just what we were looking for...right over the lake, covered, lovely breeze and a large table with a grill. The owners were friendly and we have fresh water and wine waiting for us. The great proximity to the central Austin location and it's lakeview was what you are paying for. The aspects I would have liked to have known about before when I was deciding are: 1) there is no door between the bedroom and living area, just a curtain. 2) you have to bring your own soap and shampoo for the shower 3) the towels are so old they did not even dry you 4) it felt very dark in the space ( the windows are the sides are covered with vines). However, if it is two of you who don't mind sharing a queen (the sleeper sofa was not comfortable) and are much more focused on the outdoors, than this is a good place for you.

I was attending a conference in Austin, May 29 –June 1, 2016 and stayed at the Tree House. I picked it over the conference hotel downtown since it offers so much more space and a very nice feeling being so close to Zilker Park and Barton Springs. The free car parking was helpful. This was my second time in The Tree House. We have stayed at other properties by Zilker Vacations and all of them are super. Dealing with the Reynolds is a pleasure. They are so helpful and courteous. The best part of Tree House is the balcony. I can spend hours there enjoying the green park. Proximity to downtown and so many nice eateries within walking distance makes this such a convenient place. I love all the nice amenities available in this rental. This was our fifth time with Zilker Vacations and will not be the last.

We enjoyed Antone's Saxon Pub, Lucky Lounge, Threadgill's and the Broken Spoke (took Texas Swing dance lessons there). It's a short walk to Barton Springs and the foot trails along the river. The Sunday brunch at Fonda San Miguel is just the best Mexican food anywhere. For cheaper fare, we love Torchy's Tacos and the little drive through on South Lamar, El Tacorrido.

The rental was very clean and well appointed, with a spacious, private deck and comfortable furniture (especially the “round” chair!) The neighborhood felt very safe and we enjoyed exploring the surrounding neighborhoods. We walked frequently to Zilker Park, Barton Creek and the Ladybird Lake trail and also used the bus system frequently for getting around. There is a bus stop near the end of Robert E. Lee Road that can be used to get the bus. This was our second time in Austin and this time we enjoyed kayaking at Barton Creek, great music at the Elephant Room, a concert at the Paramount (Mavis Staples) and Bob Schneider at the Saxon Pub. Also the Umlauf Sculpture Garden, which is right down the road from the Treehouse, and definitely worth a visit.

Although we've visited the Austin area a few times, we have always stayed with family and never so close to downtown. From booking the accommodation to checking out, Cynthia, Jay and Peach were more than accommodating, providing us with everything we needed to make our stay comfortable.

The property was as described, if not better. It was lovely and clean, and a perfect size for the three of us to stay. The terrace suited our morning coffee routine very nicely, and the kitchen was fully equipped for the occasional time that we didn't eat out. The bed in the master bedroom was so comfortable that I barely missed my own bed at all (something I never thought I would say).

Travelling from the UK, we are usually quite tired when we arrive, and the check in details that we received were so helpful, making the whole process so much easier than we expected it to be.

The location of the property suited us perfectly, being so close to the fabulous (if not a little cold) barton springs made it super convenient to pop down for a morning swim. I really don't think that there would be a location that would suit us more.

We can't wait for our next visit and would definitely recommend the Treehouse as a great venue.

It is a great location-the accomodations are nice and they provide everything you need--shampoo, conditioner, soap, lotion, dishes, utensils, condiments, coffee, creamer, sugar. I had no idea some of those things would be included and I brought a lot of it--next time I will just grab my clothes, snacks and beverages and I'm done. Jay was so nice too. I would highly recommend it to anyone.

Everything you could possibly need is provided, right up to the Brita water pitcher in the refrigerator. All you need is clothes and whatever food you might want to cook. But cooking is only one option, with all of South Austin at your doorstep. Downtown is only a short ride away. Transportation by car or cab is probably the best way to get around. The Treehouse has two reserved parking spaces. Wireless wifi worked beautifully, as well as cable TV on a large flat screen. The beds were very comfy, and the living area perfect for a long or short stay. There is a laundry room available with two washers and dryers, at no cost.

The owners were easy to work with and receptive to whatever we needed---which wasn't much due to their thoughtful provisioning. We will definitely be back to one of their properties.

The beds are super comfortable and easy to sleep all day in after late night concerting! I normally can't sleep in very long on vacation but the mattress was crazy comfortable even after sleeping 9 hours+. Much of the stuff you don't get at other vacation rentals was included like coffee beans and filters, laundry detergent, shampoo and soap, dvds, pool towels, some condiments in the fridge (i even scored a welcome ice cream sandwich that was left in the freezer- jackpot) We were thrilled to be less than a five minute walk to the back entrance of barton springs pool, 1 mile to austin java (great food and coffee) and less than 2 miles to whole foods and anthrolpologie. we loved it and will return asap

In addition, the condo is extremely close in to town and all of Austin's downtown attractions. The condo itself is plenty roomy with comfortable beds and furnishings. It was handy having on-site laundry. Of course, the highlight of this condo (aside from location, location, location) is the covered patio and the glass wall.

The whole idea seemed to be troublesome and expensive. I work for a company that requires me to travel alot and i have been in and out of hotels. Hotels are all that i knew and then one day i was brave enough to visit Home Away.com and expand my horizon. I was visiting Austin to celebrate my ""birthday"" at my ladies mothers house and needed a place to stay that provided a comfortable home environment. I needed the place to be PERFECT due to the fact that the reason to gather my family was for my birthday but in reality i was planning to propose to my lady. I needed to rent a home that would create beautiful memories along with comfort and a ""homie"" environment. As i searched the website a home caught my eye that was known as the ""tree house"". I proceeded in calling Jay and immediately knew that i wanted to rent from him due to his unique friendly personality. He's the type of person that you automatically feel comfortable doing business with. I rented the home and to my surprise the process was extremely simple and there was no checking into a long line at a lobby or robotic people at a front desk. Jay also provided me with his direct cell phone number which was a kind gesture. Oh and the prices were affordable!!! I am truly happy that i decided to rent a home from HomeAway and especially happy that i had the opportunity to meet Jay. I have his phone number on speed dial and will definately look forward to renting directly from him again. Thanks Jay!

Right by Zilker park, we were within walking distance of the park with the beautiful springs, and also super close to some awesome restaurants like Chuy's and the Green Mesquite. We could not have picked a better location in all of Austin as far as I'm concerned.

 The owners were also very hospitable, leaving maps, restaurant guides, and a personalized letter outlining some of the highlights of Austin that we should check out. If I called any one of them with a question or concern, they would repsond immediatly, and were also available to stop by the property if there were any issues, which we had none. We felt very welcome there.

 The treehouse was clean, cute, and had a cute little patio with a view of the treetops overlooking part of the park. I feel we really lucked out especially with the location being so close to the best parts of Austin. Thankyou so much Peach,Cynthia, and Jay, I can honestly say that I will never be staying in a hotel for vacation again when there are great places like this!

We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay or a better weekend. The highlight of our trip was being able to jump into the cool waters of Barton Springs after a full day of bike riding, then going to the food truck park and trying out all of the amazing specialties each one had to offer. We will definitely be booking again in the near future.

Deliciously close to Barton Springs Pool. The tips from other renters to get a small car were on the spot, you get to park just by the front door of the flat (great when you arrive with the kid asleep). I'd definitely recommend having a car as the nearest shops are a good 10-minute walk away (and I'm lazy as hell). The owners are great and extremely helpful. Thank you for a great stay!

The small complex is quiet & picturesque. The unit Is far more accommodating & unique over staying in a hotel, & for the same money. The Studio is best suited for a couple or small family (we had 2 adults+2 small kids) who are tolerant of small spaces. I was surprised to not see a ceiling fan, an Austin necessity, even in this smaller unit, and may have preferred it over the noisey AC unit fan. Perhaps having a small floor fan could be an alternative? There were plenty of outlets for such. As one who has rented other vacay property for comparison, I would stay here again with my family as the pluses far outweigh the minuses! Thanks Team Zilker!

The board games were a nice touch, and when we came in late the first night, we ended up staying up til past midnight playing some games together. Cynthia texted me the afternoon we were coming in to see what time we would be there so she could leave the light on for us, and that was an unexpected nice touch.

The pictures that you see are exactly what you get. The studio was very clean, and super spacious. We loved the huge walk in closet for keeping luggage out of the way! The kitchen was well stocked with all of the dishes and utensils needed. The linens were fresh and clean and we appreciated the toiletries provided.

We could not have been happier with the location. Zilker Park and Barton Springs is within walking distance. We did rent a car and were within a 5-10 minute drive to all of the Downtown/South Congress attractions. The neighborhood was great and we felt very safe and at home.

There was plenty of space and Beth was kind enough to leave an extra airbed in case we needed it. The place was clean and amenities were provided. Also - the refrigerator was cleared out for us to use!

Pictures don't do it justice - truly a lovely home. The owners were very easy to work with--accommodating, informative, with a simple rental agreement and easy communication. Second, the home was very well appointed with plenty of bath towels and high quality linens on all the beds. The house was also immaculately clean, and I mean immaculate! The owner met us on arrival and there were easy directions posted thoughtfully in the home.

The home is a short cab ride (less than $10) from downtown and the Austin Convention Center, so that you are close without the hustle and bustle. (Although getting a taxi for a timely pick up is a bit of a challenge - I'd consider a rental car next time.) Don't feel like cooking? Magnolia restaurant is a 2 minute walk from the front door. My only regret is that we didn't have time to really enjoy the outdoor space, save for coffee on the deck in the morning. Otherwise this was a perfect experience in Austin.

There was a slight scheduling conflict but Karen was great about working around it. She answered my questions pretty quickly and even hooked me up with some coffee! The couch is so soft I could have slept on that instead of the bed if I wanted to.

Only thing I would want to let future renters know is that you will have to walk along the fence to the adjacent property and they have 2 large poodles or mixes that bark and jump at the fence as you go. I like dogs so it didn't bother me at all but I can see how someone who is afraid of dogs would maybe have an issue at least the first time going past. They were not able to get through the fence and when I was sitting outside they quieted down, they really aren't a problem.

We made it to/from the airport in less than 15 minutes. If you are planning to walk to South Congress Street for shopping, etc. you might want to consider an alternate method to save you some time (it would be a long walk). We ate at Curra's and Whip In which are both nearby to the property, and great ""local"" atmospheres. The property was clean and well maintained. Karen was very prompt when responding to our booking request. She helped explain the location of the property, and interesting things to do in Austin. She also offered to pick us from the airport, which would have taken her up on had we not been renting a car. Karen was very transparent up front about the fact we might hear noise coming from upstairs in the early morning hours due to the work schedules of the tenants who live upstairs (we slept right through any noise that may have been occurring). If traveling to Austin again, my wife and I will definitely stay here again.

Quick Tip: Uber & Lyft are no longer operating in Austin, and the public transit system seems to leave people waiting for long periods of time. Austin can be experienced best by renting a car. It is much cheaper than you would think especially if booking in advance.

While the properties are located in a quiet neighborhood, you are still in walking distance to Zilker Park, the hike and bike trail that surrounds Lady Bird Lake, and ""restaurant row"" on Barton Springs Road, and Umlauf sculpture garden. Some of the near by restaurants that we enjoyed eating at during our stay were El Alma and El Meson for excellent authentic Mexican food and Maudie's for TexMex, the Elizabeth Cafe, Bouldin Creek cafe, Austin Java, 24 Diner, Shady Grove, the Picnic food Court, Black's Barbecue, Lucy's Fried Chicken, Whole Foods and the Shake Shack. My husband and I walked on the hike and bike trail every day of our 10 day visit. South Congress Avenue and downtown are a longer walk or a quick drive away. The Reynolds provide excellent customer service. They reply promptly to phone calls and address any concerns immediately. The property is clean and well-maintained. A lot of thought is put into providing for any needs. The kitchen is extraordinarily well stocked.

There was a mix-up and the original house I booked with the owners was double-booked, but they immediately fixed the situation and I was able to book the Kaleido house without a problem. There was plenty of board games, cable TV, a nice porch, and the shower was the coolest one I've been in. Overall, this was a great property and we were very pleased with the entire experience.

It's set up high, so it feels private, and the neighborhood is peaceful. It's hard to believe that you're so close to everything. You are in the heart of the '04 zip code, right near the best restaurants, bars, and music. Right behind Zilker Park and Barton Springs pool too. The home is clean, and the listing is accurate. We particularly enjoyed the large window in the dining area that looks out over a beautiful live oak tree.

1045,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p290688#reviews,"Aug 3, 2016",5/5,"Beautiful house, great location!","Our stay at the Kaleido House was definitely an enjoyable one! We chose this property because of the good location (close to Zilker Park/Barton Springs Pool) and also because it was colorful and cheerful. Cynthia and Jay were excellent hosts! We received thorough information prior to arrival, and they were always extremely responsive each time we had a question. They also let us borrow a few chairs and pool noodles for our trip to Barton Springs, which we greatly appreciated.

The living area (as well as the rest of the house) was very clean and comfortable--the kiddos enjoyed several board games and also the large TV with cable connection. Several Austin-themed magazines were also available as well as a helpful binder with restaurant and event suggestions. There was also a good selection of DVDs and books.

The kitchen was stocked with coffee (beans and also ground) and teas. Plenty of plates, dishes, pots and pans were available, but we didn't have time to use them.

The spa tub was so nice! There were two shower heads and two faucets--the jets were not operable, but we did enjoy very relaxing baths there. Shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, face wipes, soaps, towels, and hair dryer were all provided.

The master bedroom was spacious and had a TV as well. The bedroom with two twin beds was perfect for our two children! They had plenty of room to spread out. We were able to wash and dry a load of clothes using the washer and dryer--very convenient. It was nice to return home with clean clothes.

The front porch is a great place to relax and have coffee or tea. The house was quiet at night (neighborhood was quiet) and we had no issues at all. I would definitely return for another stay, and I would definitely recommend this property as well.

"
1046,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p290688#reviews,"May 4, 2016",4/5,A nice place,"Overall, a very nice place. The property was largely as described. We did have a little bit of a communication issue related to getting a high chair for our baby, but the owners resolved it quickly. Two things I will mention, mostly as suggestions for future travelers.

1. The only bathtub is a very large whirlpool tub. As per the instructions in the house, using it requires a second water heater, which must be turned on an hour prior to use. Not super convenient if you want to give your kids a bath. We opted for showers--the tub is quite large, so this worked fine, just a word of warning. Also, it's quite a big step down into the tub--if you are mobility impaired, it would be almost impossible to get in and out.

2. The property is advertised as walking distance to a large, local park. The walk is about a mile, but the park itself is huge, so visiting various attractions in the park requires additional walking. Not unmanageable, but we had a six year old and a fifteen month old, which made it a challenge. Also, the walk involves a very large hill, so it can be quite taxing in the heat.

We were satisfied with our stay, and would definitely consider staying here again.

1047,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p290688#reviews,"Apr 21, 2016",5/5,"Clean, convenient and comfortable","Our family of four had a great time staying at the Kaleidoscope house. The house is conveniently located to central attractions in Austin. Since we have little kids, the Zilkher park train and park were a big hit! The house was clean, warm and accommodating for a family with two young kids. We had a hard time finding a rental that had twin beds for our kids to sleep in, but this one fit the bill! I also liked that the bedrooms could easily be made dark despite day light savings time (important when you have little ones).

The only piece of the house that was not my favorite (but was clearly communicated in the listing) was the bath tub/shower. The tub has very steep steps and is awkward to get into and out of. You definitely need to be able bodied to use the tub.

That said, I would definitely be willing to stay here again and would recommend to others!

The condo was immaculately clean, tastefully decorated, and the bedding/sheets/towels were nice. Beds were comfortable. Plenty of things like toilet paper and laundry detergent, spices in the kitchen, etc. We cooked one night and had everything we needed as far as kitchen utensils. It was wonderful to have freshly ground coffee and a good coffee maker. The location is great, we enjoyed shopping on congress ave, walking at zilker park, canoeing the river, etc. Honestly the only minor thing to note is that in the spa tub the jets are non-operational. The listing is accurate and doesn't say jetted tub or anything, I just saw the huge bathtub in the picture and assumed I would be taking a jet bath. The bathroom is amazing nonetheless!

help us out with anything else needed. Beds were comfy, plenty of towels, lots of cups, enough blankets and pillows, and they even had a Brita pitcher filled for us! I thought that was pretty awesome of them because we needed to stay hydrated with all the drinking we did all weekend! The house was in close proximity to everything we wanted to do including sixth street, an awesome hookah bar, Congress St., and the bat bridge. A few taxi rides were taken and it was about $15 w/ tip from sixth st. back to the house! The people in Austin were super nice and we enjoyed everyone we met and every place we visted!

The home is stocked with everything that you may need. kitchen fully stocked, bedrooms well appointed, lanai makes for great coffee time, there is also a BBQ that was great for the days when we didnt feel like cooking inside. The home is very clean and cozy, and the location is excellent. We have our puppy with us so being so close to Zilker Park was wonderful. We went to the park daily, sometimes twice a day, often with a picnic blanket - made for great relaxation.

The canoeing on Lady Bird Lake is right there as well - wonderful to do on a sunny day. Barton Springs Pool is also right there - though we never made it this time around, we will be sure to get to it next time. Austin is full of great restaurants - many of them are near by within walking distance or only a short drive away.

The quiet neighborhood was great for a morning walk and Kaleido is a short walk to Barton Springs. We even braved the pool (not too cold for an Oregonian!)

It's just a pleasant two-mile walk to downtown, but we had to stop at some great eating spots - Chuy's & Green Mesquite BBQ - along the way! Our hosts were so helpful and advises us w/local activities, too! Highly recommend it and would stay here again!

We arrived later than anticipated and just like Motel 6, they left the light on for us so it was pretty easy to find.

The house itself was in emmaculate condition, everything was clean but if you get dirty, there is a washer and dryer you can use. Coffee was fully stocked as was a refreshing pitcher of water in the fridge, spice drawer also stocked. A stove and barbeque pit are there for you if you want to stay in and cook. the decor inside was nice, the bedding was extremely comfortable. We had to force ourselves to get out of the house and engage in outdoor activities, so we took a short drive out to dripping springs (hamilton pool) to go on a hike with our 2 sons. When we returned, we walked the neighborhood and played outside in the front yard. The place had a variety of dvd movies for us to watch as well as an assortment of board games to play. We taught our 6 yr old how to play chess and he has asked to play everyday since we got back to our home in Corpus Christi, TX. There is a table for 6 and you can request a high chair and/or booster seat at no additional cost. Iron, hairdryer, additional bedding are all located in the closet. Basic toiletries were also provided (shampoo/soap/body wash as well as guest towels). The giant oak tree located in front of the porch has to be at least 100 yrs old and provided nice shade and privacy. The shower /tub could easily fit four people, that's how big it is and you have 2 shower heads hitting your body on each side.

The rate was much pricier than what we're used to paying, we stayed at the Austin Motel on South Congress on our last visit, which is in a great location but during our last trip we lost a good 2 hrs of sleep after some guests were having a conversation right outside of our room. I said ""never again"" and on this trip, I made it a point to do better research on places to stay in Austin, I came across some very small font on ""google maps"" and saw the words Zilker Vacations on the map. I clicked on it as I was intrigued and it led me to the website. I read reviews and booked it for the date that I wanted, full payment is expected 2 wks prior to date of arrival. Everything was perfect, can't say enough about this place which is why I used all space allowed on here. :)

It is also close to Barton springs where we went swimming almost every day. To top it all off, it was also equipped with a washer and dryer so we came home with no laundry to do!

My husband and I have stayed in some very nice (and one not-so-nice) condos all over the US and Cayman Islands, but have never been so overwhelmed with amenities. The list far exceeded our expectations and previous experiences: local coffee, spices, shampoo, conditioner and body wash, organic teas, condiments in the fridge, toilet paper, dish soap, dishwashing soap, laundry soap; hand soap, trash bags, foil, coffee maker, coffee grinder, tea kettle, tea pot, recycling bin...Generally we have had to either bring or buy all of these things; they're the little things you take for granted at home and exceeded the amenities of hotels. Also loved the location: within biking distance to Zilker and downtown - starting with a lovely hill that was great going down. I had to walk my bike back up. Enough parking for our adult children to visit, and enough space at the kitchen table for eight of us to gather to eat and play games. Double showers were great; the tub is definitely a bit of a climb getting in and out, but the cool factor outweighed the strange factor. Just another quirk in this very ""keep Austin weird"" place. Pictures show the painted furniture and bright rooms, but they don't really do justice to the feel of the condo. Two couples could easily stay without running all over one another. The porch provided a nice outside location to sit and visit, and we were treated to a little bit of guitar playing and singing by the neighbors one evening. Extremely relaxing. Finally, the bed was comfy. I'm just not as young as I used to be, and I like soft beds. We will definitely stay here again.

The description was accurate and it was clean and very well-maintained. We received a few emails from the owners before our arrival to let us know about our stay and ask if there was anything we needed before we arrived. The location was great, just down the street from Zilker Park, and there was plenty of room for our close family to celebrate our son's 2nd birthday. We plan on making another booking with this property in the future.

The house was clean and just as described in the listing. The decor, in bright colors in keeping with the kaleidoscope theme, was charming. The beds were great; even the queen size sofa bed was the most comfortable our son had ever slept on. The kitchen had everything this foodie family needed to prepare some great meals. There were so many thoughtful extras provided with this house~from beach towels and family games, videos and books, to a kitchen supplied with many extras including coffee beans & a grinder! Our kids loved the huge spa tub/shower. Everything functioned perfectly~from the air conditioner to the washer-dryer to the well-equipped kitchen. The owners were very hospitable, with Jay emailing us us ahead of our stay with all the info we needed about the house and surrounding area. Another one of the owners, Cynthia, even emailed me with a link to a free concert during our stay. The third owner, Peach, called us during our stay to make sure any issues were addressed. All in all, their customer service was excellent. The unit is walking distance to Zilker Park, in a clean and generally quiet neighborhood. My 12 year old son just looked over my shoulder at this review, pointed at a picture of the Kaleido house, and commented ""awesome, awesome, awesome!""

Zilker Park and Barton Springs is just around the corner, and it is minutes away from some great locally-owned restaurants. The owners made renting extremely pleasant.

Everything was fresh and clean and well stocked, just as described. We cooked up a great Christmas Eve dinner for 6 of us and we were happy to find a small grocery store just a couple of blocks away for the things we forgot to get at HEB and Whole Foods!

The location was absolutely perfect for exploring the city. We walked to Zilker Park, Barton Springs and the hike and bike trail EVERY day - and one of us bicycled almost 100 miles total on both sides of Lady Bird Lake while there. We loved being close - but not too close - to our daughter who lives in Travis Heights, a quick and safe bike ride away. Near to lots of restaurants and some great coffee shops as well, although the owners provided us with local organic coffee beans.

We would recommend this rental to anyone wanting a real home away from home. Jay, Cynthia and Peach made it easy to book our stay and gave us lots of information on things to do and made us feel at home. We did not need a thing except nice weather, which obliged until the last day! We highly recommend this rental!

When my 9 year old daughter and I got there, we were instantly blown away by the place. The photos are accurate...this place is colorful and clean and beautiful. They provided coffee beans and a grinder so I could grind my own coffee...it was a treat! There is a binder filled with area info that we used daily. There were menus, coupons, maps, etc. The owners really did think of everything. Beach towels, filtered water in the fridge, DVD's and games on the bookshelf, an umbrella if it were to rain, bug spray on the porch...it was all there.

We walked to Barton Springs Pool one day, and rode our bikes the next. The location is perfect. We enjoyed our stay so much, we extended it an extra day. I will definitely be back. This place felt like home.

I already miss it. I could have moved in. I would rent this again in a heartbeat. I actually would recommend any of their properties knowing how well they maintained this one and how awesome their communication was. I even received a call the day we checked in to see if we needed anything. Their hospitality was wonderful. I knew if I did need anything or have a question they would be a phone call away.

I also loved the keyless entry...how great to not have to carry keys anywhere. Thank you again, Jay and Cynthia. You have a new renter. I hope to come back every year.

You can tell you put a lot of thought into your decorations, amenities, and paint colors. I will be spreading the word (although the selfish part of me doesn't want anyone to know about my little home away from home so it will always be available when I need it). :)

The house was also perfectly stocked with coffee makings, bottled water and filtered water, laundry detergent, etc. The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom nice and spacious.

The family room is very comfortable with plenty of seating and a lovely large television, cable, and a library of DVDs. The WiFi is also complimentary and very much appreciated!

The owners are very professional and extremely attentive. I was contacted during my stay to ""check in"" and make sure all my needs were met. When I told them the ages of my children they made several offers to provide certain kid-friendly items. Very appreciated!

(The programmable coffee machine alone is a huge plus, both for business travelers and parents of small children alike.)

When we could not get into Barton Springs Pool due to the very long line, my daughter absolutely loved the very big bathtub! We filled it with a few inches of water, and she splashed away - enjoying every minute.

The owners were prompt and communicative. They left plenty of current guides for our use, and offered further information as necessary, but also allowed us our privacy. We greatly enjoyed our stay, and when we return to Austin, we'll be checking out the Kaleidoscope House availability first.

We spent most of our time on the wonderful dock (a gorgeous view and a great place for coffee in the mornings and wine in the evenings), on the screened in porch and in the Kayaks on the lake (such a pretty part of Lake Austin). In a previous review, one guest mentioned that there is a public boat ramp next door. While that is true, it is not even visible from the property. The property is very private and very quiet. The owners live there, but we hardly even saw them. And, when we did, they were warm and friendly. All my exchanges with Linda were wonderful. We loved the lush landscaping, the Adirondack chairs around the fire pit and Mango, the cockatoo. If you want a shiny new condo or a hotel experience, this may not be the place for you. However, if you want a unique and peaceful cabin on the lake (a good for your soul cabin), you will love it!

"
1087,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p292796#reviews,"May 18, 2018",3/5,"Great, but shared space","I would more accurately describe this rental as “remote” rather than secluded and “shared” rather than private. There are windows everywhere, comfy furnishings, a large screened-in porch and a fully equipped kitchen which are all terrific features inside the cabin. To describe the bathroom as “rustic” would be a stretch. The only viable shower to use is a hand-held unit which you access by climbing inside the large Jacuzzi tub (if you have mobility issues, this cabin is not for you). The views and easy access to the deck & dock are also fabulous—you will have to remind yourself you are in Texas when you look at all the lush greenery and water that surrounds you. However, the description does not disclose that the cabin is sandwiched between the owner’s home and the owner’s office. So, the fabulous views you have include frequent sightings of one of the owners tinkering with the yard or working in his office. And, there is the realization that all those windows that allow you to see out, also allow the owners to see you inside. Now, the owners are totally entitled to enjoy their property, and Phillip is a very pleasant fellow. But, if you have fantasies of privacy, please know that this is very much a shared space and prepare accordingly [the property description should also be adjusted for full disclosure]. As mentioned in other posts, the property is next door to a public boat dock, and is next to a residence on the other side, so there is considerable noise from people unloading and loitering at the dock & from their activities in the water that may begin very early in the morning and extend late into the evening. While I would not stay here again, those of you that are more social and desire access to the water and views you won’t find anywhere else in Austin, this cabin would be right for you.

No buildings can be seen on the opposite shore. We lounged on the day bed in front of a huge window, watching lizards and birds enjoy the sunshine. Later moved the lounging out to the dock to watch the sunset over the tree covered shoreline. Beautiful, secret garden type of place. So peaceful, green and relaxing.

From the moment you enter the long winding driveway for the property, you feel like you have been transported away to a tropic paradise in the middle of the Texas desert, complete with Mango the Cockatiel and flowering banana plants.

The cabin was rustic, but very clean. It was tastefully decorated and stocked with EVERYTHING you might need for a weekend (or more getaway). I can't think of a single thing that we might have wanted/needed that wasn't there. All you need to bring is your clothing, and food. . It is literally feet away from the ""lake."" Two Kayaks were provided, for the use of guests. There is a public boat dock next door, but during the time we visited, traffic on the lake was minimal.

If you do find that you need anything, there are stores just ten miles or so down the road. Phillip and Linda made themselves available if we needed anything, but otherwise left us to enjoy the property. Linda did provide as great tip about visiting an eatery (the Oasis) that has an absolutely stunning view of a nearby lake (Travis). We also asked about renting paddle boards, and within hours Phillip gave us contact information on someone who not only rents them, but would deliver them to the property.

We took our 8 and 9 yr old boys and everyone had a blast. They had plenty to do. This place is a perfect fit for a couple or a family of four. The cabin is very clean and neatly decorated. It provided so many things that are not found at a hotel. It was also convenient for taking the kids to float the Guadalupe & going to Schlitterbahn. Linda was very sweet and made the entire process very simple. The pictures of the place do not do it justice. From the incredible views, to the talking bird Mango outside, and being steps away from the cabin to the water...it was perfect.

The screened in porch is great for meals, or there is a table and chairs outside as well. Just a really nice place - you feel like you're at a lakehouse and you are.

1110,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p293833#reviews,"Jul 29, 2018",5/5,Perfect distance and size,"There’s definite pluses and minuses to this property rental. First of all on the negative note the rental was not ready on time. The cleaning lady was running behind and therefore made our check in time an hour later. The king bed was hard and made it difficult for me to sleep. It is a bottom unit and the people above were falling over or something around 2am. They were outrageously loud. The street the house is on is packed with vehicles. And the driveway is very steep. There is a lot to rave about on the plus side though. We were let in late but they made it up by offering wine or fresh whole bean coffee. Which I choose the coffee. The unit was very clean. It gave me and my three kids plenty of sleeping room. The place is so cozy and cute. It’s serene with all the woods surrounding the house. It’s literally down the hill and across the street from Barton springs. We walked there in no time at all. The house is in a great location. My kids loved the games you had to play. I want to bring my boyfriend here next. However I may consider renting the top unit instead. Way to go wrens nest. I loved it and thank you for the great price!!

Having the accommodations of the Wren had all the conveniences of home but up in the trees. It's conveniently located to most activities within central Austin. The property manager Amanda is gracious which helps make your stay at the Wren a wonderful retreat after a day of exploration.

The proximity to Barton Springs is unbeatable and the walk along the greenbelt presents you with the tranquil sound of water and the invitation for wading - so bring you suits. One event if you want to do something entirely different is to visit The Panic Room. It's where you're grouped with several individuals to help escape quarters by breaking codes and unlocking locks within a specific time - we were in The Bomb room... I'm typing this so - I guess I escaped ;o) Another beauty is The State Capital - worth a visit. It also goes without mention... there are restaurants, bars and music at every corner. We found Shady Groove close to the Wren quite yummy. The dueling piano on 6th Street was a hoot - all relatively close to the property, however having the convenience of a car made our getting around more efficient... just beware, you have to pay for parking everywhere.

The property is managed with pride and if you want to feel like your at home this is the place for you. ~ Enjoy

Two minute walk to the edge of Zilker park. From there you've got your pick on getting around, sidewalks, trails that go on for miles and can get you to downtown. If you're a casual bike rider and don't need anything fancy, there's batches of B-Cycle stations close by and at $8 per day or $25 per week, its hard to beat the convenience.

Alamo Drafthouse is a 12 minute walk and the best place in Austin to catch a movie.

The space is the lower level of their home, but completely separate from their living quarters. There is no sound bleed from upstairs.

The setting is gorgeous and very private. All of the windows look out on trees and bamboo. The kitchen has floor to ceiling windows, and you get a great view of all of the birds, squirrels and other creatures scurrying about.

The heating and cooling system works beautifully and you have full control of it. The floors and carpeting is clean, as is the furniture and appliances. Tons of countertop space in the kitchen. The fridge (on the small side), dishwasher, stove, oven, water pressure and water temperatures are all in working order. Lots of kitchen gadgets and utensils, and the dish ware and glasses are great.

The tv and DVD player work great. Antenna TV only, no cable. Wonderful washer and dryer in the unit.

The bedroom is HUGE, and the king bed is very comfortable. Ample supply of linens and towels. Ample closet space, although no dressers or drawers. Two sinks in the bathroom, lots of counter space. Great water pressure in the shower and the temperature is easily controlled.

A beautiful patio right outside the door, and we grilled out many times.

An easy walk to the stunning trail that goes along Lady Bird Lake and easy access to the magical Barton Springs Pool.

It felt so right bringing a brand new baby into our ""home"" even though at that point we only had a couple of weeks left on the lease.

We enjoyed the location for a good breakfast at Austin Java located on Barton Spring Rd. Coffee was excellent with a hot breakfast.

To celebrate our anniversary we ate at The Oasis on Lake Travis to experience the often talked-about sunset views. We recommend getting to the Oasis between 6:30 – 7:30 for the daily sunset event and ask to sit at the Crows Nest if you really want a little bit of privacy. Austin was a wonderful place to celebrate our anniversary.

Can't speak for other properties on the site, but our 5 days in the Wren's Nest have been great. Spacious, private, comfortable, clean, super convenient location and idyllic surroundings. So glad we didn't decide to stay somewhere right on South Congress or 6th Street area as we could walk, bike or drive/park to either place easily and then had the option of coming back to the quiet peacefulness of the Wren's Nest and getting away from the noisy hustle and bustle of those areas - and to tell the truth - we both preferred the little area down the hill & around the corner from the Nest on Barton Springs Road (five or six restaurants and bars, great bbq place, flipnotics coffee bar and crepe stand on jessie) as well as the area just across the river on and around Lamar (and the Whole Foods ""Superstore""--gotta at least check it out). Plus, we could walk right to Zilker Park and Barton Springs (awesome swimming) in literally five minutes - you can see glimpses of the park through the bamboo & trees from the beautiful panoramic

windows in the kitchen that look out over the hillside back yard. My girlfriend and I both agreed that for our money we would both rather spend two or more days at the Wren's Nest than at any of the 4 star hotels downtown. It's really a nice place; architecturally cool, cool location, cool owners (super accommodating) and cool decor. We will definitely be looking to stay here again next time we are in Austin.

It's literally located at the feet of 6th St and there isn't a single need for a car the entire weekend if you plan on just sticking around Austin. Using the info from one of the other reviews we grabbed a shuttle from the airport and it dropped us off right in front of the building. The balcony doesn't overlook 6th St but that almost certainly helps in the noise department.

We had 6 in the unit and everyone slept comfortably. There is only 1 bathroom and that's a bit of a drawback but we made it work just fine.

Just to give an indicator of how well we all liked the place, I have a friend whose possibly traveling to Austin this spring who stayed here and this was his first option for accommodations.

Close to the Driskill for the wedding we were attending, an easy walk to the children's museum with our grandson, and a fun view of Halloween partying on 6th street from the loft's balcony. We are in Austin a lot but this was a new and very enjoyable experience. The loft was charming and very comfortable.

The owners were very forward about the noise of 6th street, so that did not deter us. We were mostly out on 6th street anyways and they provided ear plugs and noise machines to drown out any noise, I had no problem sleeping at all. The place was so much nicer than I expected! I thought if it was on 6th street it might be sort of a party house and a little run down, but not at all! Gorgeous home, very well kept and super comfortable. We had 6 girls stay and we were fine with one bathroom, though we had to schedule showers! Loved this place, big windows with an awesome view of downtown. i was very impressed and will definitely try to book next time I'm in Austin!

It is a beautiful condo and in a great location. You have some GREAT neighbors who are fun to chat with on the balcony.

Getting into the building was a breeze and the security guys are very helpful! There is a little grocery store just around the corner on Congress we walked to for some snacks.

I can't say enough wonderful things about the condo. You can hear and see all the action from the clubs/bars on 6th street. The music from 6th was not an issue for us getting to sleep. The noise level was barely above background noise and even soothing for getting to sleep. Anyone who complains about the noise is FAIR WARNED in the description of the condo.

Thank you so much for allowing visitors this wonderful opportunity! We will definitely be staying at this condo again ( we have a September trip already planned)

The location was perfect, and it fit the six of them very well. It slept all 6 comfortably, and they managed to do just fine with the one bathroom. The kitchen was well equipped so we were able to eat a couple meals in. And it's within walking distance of just about everything you want to do in downtown Austin.

Definitely could hear the bars and the crowds until about 3am, but that was their scene anyway so wasn't a problem.

The furniture was in great shape, and the place was nicely decorated. Would be very spacious for 2-3 people, but can definitely accommodate 4-6 without any problems.

Way cheaper than 2 hotel rooms in any of the downtown hotels, so a great option if you've got a small group spending a few days . Has a garage parking space too if you've got a car, which is awesome. And the $1 airport bus drops off and picks up literally in front of the building if you don't have a car.

We had an easy walk across the pedestrian bridge to get to the festival, driveway parking (really important, as streetside parking near ACL is practically nonexistent) and a lovely home to stay in. There are lots of things to do nearby and I would highly recommend the Magnolia Cafe a block away - it's always open and serves great food. We meant to get in a swim at Deep Eddy pool a block further, but didn't have time.

Martha's communications were perfect. Everything was laid out ahead of time, and she even made a personalized code for the lock so we couldn't forget it. In addition, she let us use the driveway for parking after we had checked out which we much appreciated.

The only down side was that we really weren't there much, as the festival took most of our time in Austin. That said, the cottage was brightly decorated, clean, and comfortable. The appliances, wifi and television worked without a hitch. She has a nice shaded porch on the back though we didn't use it much due to time.

It was comfortable and felt like home, offering me a relaxing atmosphere to come ""home"" to after long, stressful days. The house was spacious, clean, comfortable, and in a wonderful location. Every basic necessity was provided - clean towels, small bottles of shampoo and conditioner, soap, facial wipes, and small bites to eat. There was the master bed room with a huge, comfortable bed. There was a roomy couch in the living room and a small twin size bed. In the room off the living room and kitchen, there was another cozy standard size bed.

The kitchen was spacious and stocked with enough cooking equipment to do just about anything. The TV worked well and wifi was strong. The bathroom was simple, spacious and extremely clean - the shower pressure was good and the temperature perfect.

There was a washer and dryer available which was perfect for maintaining laundry needs without worrying about hitting the laundromat. The home also provided basic necessities to wash and dry clothes. The bed was absolutely comfortable and provided a great night's rest. The a/c worked perfectly. I arrived late in the night, and accessing the house was effortless. Martha was easily accessible, if needed.

Within walking distance: Magnolia Cafe (open 24 hours), Juiceland, convenient store on the corner, local watering hole (Deep Eddy Cabaret), the running trail, Deep Eddy pool, and Zilker Park. Access to MoPac was convenient as it was literally a few meters away. In the other direction was a CVS and other places to eat.

I've stayed in Austin at other HomeAway locations on various occasions which are comparable in terms of location, although the other locations were smaller and at a lower nightly rate. However, this was probably the best location I've stayed at overall in terms of price, location, space, and convenience. I found the price to be quite reasonable considering all the factors stated above.

I should also mention that the back porch situated in front of the driveway (yes, bonus! - a driveway) is quite nice, although I did not use it; I could imagine it would be a nice spot to kick back and drink a cold beer. There were no faults with this location, in my opinion. The entire week I found the neighborhood to be quiet and peaceful, and the house was so cozy and comfortable.

There were six of us in our group and we all fit comfortably in the house. Initially our worry was that the house only had one bathroom but really it was a non-issue. The location of the house was fantastic in terms of being near downtown, zilker park and trails. It took us about 10 minutes walking to get to zilker park and well for ACL you can't ask for more! There are also several restaurants within walking distance. We ate at Magnolia Cafe, they are yummy!

 Over this past year I have discovered renting houses is preferable to renting hotels, because it is more comfortable. I love having a kitchen and not having to eat out for every single meal. The house is comfy and clean. We did enjoy the deck and the neighbors are friendly too. Also had Wi-fi always a plus!

 I would love to stay here again. Martha was awesome in her communication skills. She is speedy to reply to emails and provided good information about the area!

A couple of blocks away from Deep Eddy Pool, and the hike and bike trail. I'd definitely stay here again.

If you want to be in a quieter location, but within walking distance to Zilker Park, the food trucks on Barton Springs, Lady Bird Lake, the hiking trails along the Lake, Barton Springs pool, and a quick Uber ride to Downtown, Rainey Street and South Congress, then this is a nice location. It's away from the crowds in a lovely residential neighborhood. The place is small, however perfect for two people sharing a queen bed. There is a couch in the living room that could work for a third person. Plenty of room for an air mattress in the living room too. The kitchen has everything you need. The bathroom is very small and outdated, and so is the closet in the bedroom, but if you are looking for something simple, priced right, somewhat quiet and close to many activities, this is a great place to stay. It's a charming cottage with a lot of curb appeal. I would definitely stay here again, either by myself, with my significant other or with a good friend. Check in and out was so very easy. Thank you!

So glad we stayed on this side of town vs more busier parts of Austin. Definitely check out all the places on Barton Springs, we ate at probably every restaurant down there off of Kinney and Barton Springs. Only complaint about the the house is the size of the bathroom and bedroom. They are very small and makes getting ready a struggle for two people. Other than that the home is welcoming and comfortable.

The cottage was comfortable, well equipped, and located exactly where we could access downtown and Barton Springs with ease. I slept soundly in the soft bed and pitch black bedroom. There are plenty of toiletries available should you forget practically anything, and numerous maps and magazines to peruse for Austin and the surrounding areas. Hopefully you'll get to meet the two cats that call the front porch home from time to time. The use of the parking space was also a welcome treat in addition to the quiet comforts of this cottage.

You can stand at the end of the street and see the beautiful downtown skyline; also, you can walk to many hotspots like the Alamo Drafthouse, Odd Duck, Uchi, Shake Shack, Café Medici, Gibson's Bar, and many more within literally 1-2 blocks. If you want to walk a few more blocks, you can easily reach a bunch of food trucks, Chuy's, Thom's Grocery, and all of Zilker Park and Barton Springs. The cottage is perfect for 2 people, and a 3rd could possible use the couch. Moving around in the bedroom and bathroom can get tight, but it's nothing that would stop me from returning. The kitchen, dining, living room, and porch are very spacious. Parking in front of the house is hassle-free. The house can be pretty quiet at night and there are no fans, so bring a noise maker or small box fan if you need noise or air. The A/C works well! Sovay has coffee and tea provided, as well a table of things you might forget: mouth wash, razors, sprays, etc. There are two towels of each size, many rolls of TP, a blow dryer, iron, and more. She has thought of everything and makes herself/her dad available to assist if you need. This place is so charming and was perfect for a getaway vacation with my boyfriend. Keep it weird!

My daughter and I were visiting Austin in early March for the Austin Kite Festival in the Park. Zilker Cottage is within walking distance to several different restaurants and Austin's famous yummy BBQ and dessert food trucks.

 Zilker Cottage itself is cozy and very clean. The kitchen has a refrigerator, coffee maker, tea kettle and even a selection of nice teas. The bedroom is very comfortable and there is a mounted TV that you can watch at the end of the day. The host of Zilker Cottage was very professional and friendly. If I had any questions or concerns, the host left me her email address and her number to get in contact with her. I felt very comfortable and safe at Zilker Cottage and I would recommend staying there when visiting Austin.

There is a large master bedroom and bathroom and the master bedroom has a sleep number bed. The two smaller bedrooms are nice with the room housing the twin bed having a trundle bed underneath.

The home was immaculate. It had a supply of basic food and some beverages when we arrived. There is a nice back yard and deck area we didn't use because Austin as above 100 degrees the week we visited. The air conditioner easily cooled the house despite the heat.

The house sits about a mile from I-35 and William Carson in an area that has many restaurants, grocers, pharmacies, and other stores within a five minute drive. It's in a very quiet neighborhood and we never heard any noise. Neighbors were friendly and waived when we entered or exited the home.

We enjoyed cooking on the grill, eating outside on the deck, and having our coffee on the patio in the morning (or a cocktail in the afternoon). The bed was comfortable, kitchen well-stocked with spices, and we were a short drive from the grocery store for other needs. Steve had some really nice touches to his place, like fresh flowers on the table.

Steve left us all sorts of treats...a bottle of wine, coffee + milk in the fridge; chocolates and fruit; plus toiletries in the bathrooms. What a nice touch.

He also left very clear directions on the home and the electronics...very helpful.

My suggestions would be to have extra blankets available. We typically don't use the heat at night (maybe it's just us)...but extra warm blankets would have been helpful.

Also, the bath/shower was not great. '50's plumbing that worked well, but not easy to turn on and off.

We fell in love with his beautiful home and yard, and it frankly was the best time we had on our trip through Texas. We had never been, and our stay in Austin made us want to return.

There is a cute french pastry shop around the corner that we visited for coffee and pastries. This house would be good for 2 adults and 2 kids. Note: There is no master bedroom or master bath. Both bedrooms are upstairs and share a hall bath.

Easy walk to 1st Street and South Congress for great dining options. Went to Fresa's Chicken al Carbon Friday night, which we all thought was great. We fit 5 in the house pretty comfortably. 2 in each bed upstairs, and 1 on the futon downstairs. Joe provided a great home and was very accommodating, leaving out some extra towels for the two dogs we brought as rain was in the forecast. The place was clean, and the beds were comfortable. Only downside was an aggressive cardinal that kept trying to get in the windows, far too early both mornings we stayed. Would recommend.

Very close to downtown, <$10 Fasten ride to downtown, 6th St., etc. We travel with our dogs a lot, but the fully fenced yard and lack of rugs made for a worry-free weekend.

We were the first ever rental tenants in this property, so everything was perfectly clean and brand new. All new amenities, appliances, furnishings, kitchenware, etc.

The cube house is just the right amount of space for 2 couples. Kitchen/living area is downstairs and wide open. A fold-flat couch, dining table & chairs, and small table & additional chairs provide a great area to sit around and talk, cook a home-cooked meal, or just relax. The contemporary interior is clean and fresh! The 2 bedrooms are both upstairs and have plenty of space and nice sized closets. Beds are plush but firm and quite comfortable. New bedding, pillows, towels. You name it, it was new.

The full bathroom upstairs is spacious enough and the tub/shower combo is nice. On-demand water heater means you never run out of hot water! Good thing for a house full of cyclists! The half bath downstairs is minimal (toilet & sink) but was a wonderful extra in an area full of old houses with only 1 bathroom.

Home owner, Joey, lives 'on property' with his house being in the front half of the lot. He is an awesome guy - very helpful with area information, restaurant recommendations, and extremely communicative.

I cannot express enough how happy we were with this property! This will be tops on my list when I return to Austin again!

The furnishings are tasteful and functional and the home is well appointed and well supplied for your short term stay. The neighborhood is well kept and tree lined, and surprisingly quiet given that it is located just a block from a major thoroughfare with plenty of shopping and many interesting restaurants. It's located very close to the Domain shopping area and is very convenient to downtown and Lake Travis. Bob, the owner, was attentive and very friendly. Arrival and departure instructions were made very clear, and a binder on the kitchen table answered any questions we had during our stay. We've stayed at over a dozen VRBO accommodations all over the world and this one is right up there at the top of our list for value, comfort, enjoyment and owner interaction.

I absolutely Love this Home and Family!!!!!

Our vacation was to visit my son for a laid back visit and attend my Grandson 3rd Birthday Party - My husband and I took our GROWN young adult kids (who had never been on a plane before) and my mother.

First of all we arrive to a very nice quiet neighborhood that was tucked away but close to everything we needed. We were greeted with SMILES and HUGS - Mr. Easter and I had communicated so much before the trip that it was like going to see relatives. I love the Easter Family! They were very welcoming and showed us every detail of the most wonderful house that accommodated all of my family needs. It was VERY CLEANED and had the little extras that you don't get when you rent Hotel suites. THE BOOK -was a great idea - It answered any and all questions you may have concerning the home. Very informative. Everything was labeled - Loved it!! I felt like I was Home. I was cleaning to sitting on the back COVERED porch drinking my morning coffee to cooking. It was wonderful.

Bob has gone above and beyond to make sure that the house is set up with all the comforts of home. We love cooking in the kitchen as it has all the tools you need to prepare a meal inside or outside at the BBQ grill.

We have stayed here several times over the recent years and now when we come to Austin there is only one place we want to stay. Bob is incredibly easy to work with and if you need anything while you are there he is very prompt to address the situation. Thanks for providing a great rental property Bob.

It had everything we needed, was extremely clean, very spacious and well located. Bob was very thoughtful and even left us cooking essentials. The 60’s diner for quick meals was well appreciated. Parking for everybody was a breeze. Everything was super clean and all linens and towels etc were top quality. I have stayed in many airbnb properties worldwide but this was our first stay in a VRBO property. If this is a precursor to the others we are looking forward to them. Simply put, from every perspective, value, location, cleanliness, ease of rental and just plain fun and satisfaction, this was absolutely wonderful.

The house is very comfortable, quiet and extremely well-maintained. I read that the kitchen had everything one would need to cook, and it was indeed true. The location was excellent, close to the junction of two major highways that got us everywhere we wanted to go quickly. When Bob learned that we would be arriving after dark, he offered to bring us a ""quick start"" breakfast for the morning. He was very friendly, helpful and welcoming, and definitely went above and beyond. You could tell he really cared about the house and the people who stay there. We would definitely reserve this house again when we come into town if it is available.

We were visiting Hill country, catching up, relaxing, and eating out. Bob's property was FABULOUS. Upon arrival, Bob was there to meet us to show us the house. The house smelled so good and clean when we walked in and Bob made us feel so welcome. The house was so nice. Bob has thought of everything (from a pack n play if you have kids to every appliance you can think of).

There were a few minor problems (as places sometimes have) but as soon as we called Bob he had it fixed immediately and to NO inconvenience to us or our stay.

Each of our group (6 women) would come back and stay in this house again, either together or with our own families.

The owner was extremely helpful and accommodating to make sure our stay was as pleasant and convenient as possible.

It was a perfect size for us, plus our 2 adult daughters & 2 young grandsons. The listing was very accurate--down to the smallest detail. The home's interior was very clean & has been totally remodelled with beautiful wood flooring, kitchen counters & appliances, bathrooms/showers, & vanities. The A/C worked great (very important for TX in July!) plus there were ceiling fans in the rooms. The bedrooms even had ""black-out"" drapes to cut down on the heat. Our 3-yr old grandson loved playing on the 50's style dinette table! The very well-equipped kitchen had every possible type of cooking pans/utensil/glasses/dishes, etc. The owner, Bob, is a local real estate broker, so the rental contract was very professional & well prepared. This made me feel comfortable knowing who I was dealing with. Bob was nice enough to provide us with a ""pack & play"" portable crib for our 4-month old grandson's use & he even went out of his way to drop off an emergency flashlight & a few extra items in case of a power outage--luckily the power never went out (there was a huge storm just after we arrived). All of our transactions with Bob were very professional. He promptly answered any emails I sent him asking questions about the house. The location was great--about 15 minutes to downtown, 20 minutes to the airport, & many great restaurants & shops nearby. We went to Trudy's for great Mexican food (& happy hour) two different evenings; it was a short walk from the house. We also went to The Domain--great shopping & many wonderful restaurants; it was less than a 10-minute drive. We wouldn't hesitate to recommend this house to friends &/or rent it again ourselves should another occasion arise to visit Austin.

Located on a quiet street in North Allandale in Austin, this 3 bedroom house was just the place to rejuvenate. It's ideally located very close to 183 and Mopac and not very far from 360 and I-35, so it was a perfect place from which to launch our day trips to Sea World, Six Flags, and horseback riding in Manor. Plus, we weren't very far at all from the Arboretum and the Domain as well as a few movie theaters for days we wanted a more relaxed itinerary.

The house itself is nicely appointed and quite comfortable for lazy days. The backyard garden is nice place to relax and watch the squirrels gather up pecans. Driving into the driveway each night, after a day of exhausting activity, we really felt like we were home. (By the way, you will need a car to get around, as this neighborhood is pretty far north of downtown.)

The owner was a real joy to work with. He made sure we had everything we needed and was very thorough in his walk-through of the house. I would most certainly recommend this vacation rental if you're looking for an affordable alternative to a hotel.

High marks for Brooks - he respects your privacy and wants your stay to be pleasant.

- Bedrooms were nice, and the master suite was spectacular. Space-foam mattresses & pillows, pretty comfortable. Big closets, too.

- Wi-Fi is good. 6 business guys all using Wi-Fi at the same time and not a spot of trouble.

- Outdoor space is 5-star. The back yard patio is big & comfortable. Tall fences in the back yard make it feel private. Master suite has its own patio, as does the top floor suite.

- The stove is amazing. It's a very expensive and unconventional Aga stove which is always on with two large cooktops and 4 oven compartments. Once you get used to it, this thing is addictive to cook on. The fridge is also noteworthy, a high-dollar oversized built-in model with tons of space. Previous guests left us some nice refreshments in there and we returned the favor when we left.

- The outdoor grill & dishwasher are aging a bit and it might be time to replace them. Also need to work on the wood floor in the kitchen which is starting to warp a bit but the floors are otherwise pretty good.

- The master bath is excellent, but the other two are merely nice. They could use shelves or someplace to put your stuff.

- The neighborhood is a mixed bag with really nice houses like this one mixed in with less nice houses, all spaced fairly close together. Not junky, but definitely urban.

- Overall, I would definitely recommend staying here. The house has a good vibe, wide open, comfortable and inviting.

The owner Brooks was excellent to work with and was always available for questions. This rental is a hidden jewel and is perfect for families or groups visiting Austin. If you are in the market for a more social and cozy feel for your stay, this is the house for you. The complete opposite of an isolated and overpriced hotel room.

1363,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3165621#reviews,"Jul 9, 2015",4/5,"Great house overall, but there were a few problems","Overall the house was great. It's very nice inside and comfortably sleeps 12 if people don't mind sharing beds, and 14 if you count couches. Brooks was generally very responsive to emails and accommodating of any requests. And the house is conveniently located close to downtown.

The problems:

1) When we arrived the backyard had not been properly cleaned. There were beer cans strewn about, trash in the fire pit, and the trash can was full to the brim with beer cans. But I emailed Brooks and he had it taken care of that afternoon.

2) The oven doesn't work. (A repair guy came to the house to fix it the first day but couldn't figure out how to light the pilot. We had not called him.)

3) We had trouble with the grill. Brooks said he had just had a group stay there and grill without problems, so I'm hesitant to say it doesn't work, but we were only able to get one of the burners working. Additionally, the grill was filthy when we arrived. We could not find a brush or utility lighter, although the cleaning crew who took care of the backyard also cleaned the grill for us.

4) The toilet in the master bedroom runs. I mentioned this to Brooks on the first day but it was not fixed during our stay. We ended up taking the chain off in the tank so we had to manually flush the toilet by lifting the rubber stopper.

5) There is no washer and dryer. Reviews as early as January have mentioned this but the listing has not been updated.

Again, great house overall, but certain things need to be addressed and/or the listing updated.

The house is beautiful and roomy--we were 17 girls and it never felt crowded. The location is fantastic--we could walk to fun Austin neighborhoods, and anywhere that we couldn't walk was a cheap and fast Uber ride away. Overall, I would absolutely recommend this house to another group of people going to Austin. The master bedroom and bathroom are amazing, with room for a crowd of women to get ready to go out for the night. Also loved the private balconies off the master bedroom and on the 3rd floor. Small detail, but the sensor lights on the stairs were much appreciated!

A few hiccups from our stay: the smoke detector battery was dying and went off a few times, then proceeded to chirp throughout the night. It was set so high up that we couldn't reach it to change the battery until the next day when we were told where the ladder was kept (in a locked closet). The oven, while explained in the app, never worked for us. Also, in one section of the app, it said that it is always on--so we thought it would be on when we arrived. In another section, it explained that you needed to request it be turned on. We ended up not using the stove or oven, but grilled all weekend instead. Also, there is a small house in the back of the property, which we were not aware of, with a man living there. It was fine, but would have been nice to know that we were sharing the yard.

With any review, the only people that will post are those that either had a really good experience, or a really bad one. Unfortunately mine falls into the really bad category.

I reserved this house for my family that flew into Texas to attend my wedding. They planned on doing some site seeing in Austin after the festivities were over and needed a place to stay. Minutes before I had to fly back home, I received a frantic call from my cousin who was desperately trying to get into the house. Frantic because she had a 9 month old with her and Texas heat can be quite unbearable for people who aren't use to it. Also because she had already spoken to the Property Manager for directions on obtaining entry into the house. With all that was going on with the wedding, I had failed to notice that the Property Manager never sent me details on how to get into the house, which was my first indication that something was off.

When my family was finally able to gain entry, they noticed that the maids had yet to come in to clean what the previous occupants left behind. Disgusted, my family asked me to cancel the reservations, but the Property Manager promised that they would have a cleaning crew come by as soon as possible. Unfortunately the cleaning crew as there until 10PM at night.

The house is setup perfectly for hosting a larger group with a lot of sleeping space, an amazing kitchen, and good outdoor space. I was nervous about there only being 3 bathrooms, but the master bath is HUGE and has two long countertops with 2 separate sinks. We had at least 5 girls utilizing the mirrors at 1 time in the master bath. We brought a chef in to cook and she easily figured out the stove and complimented the kitchen.

We spent late nights outside playing guitars and singing and had no prpblems with the neighbors saying we were too loud. The Aga stove was a little bit of a pain but we made it work. There were enough towels and pillows for everyone but no hangars. There was no iron and ironing board but we went out and purchased one and Brooks reimbursed us with no problem. Brooks was great to deal with and very accomodating. We would definitely use this house again if we ever come back to visit.

Just a short walk, uber or car ride to everything you'd want in Austin, also just steps from E. 11th st, where you can find great dining spots like Blue Dahlia and Hillside Pharmacy and Franklin's BBQ.

Communicating with the owner prior to the trip was simple and effective in ensuring the house would suit our group's needs. Using the homeaway app was instrumental in communicating services like entry into the home, wifi passwords, and house specifics.

One note to be aware of - the oven/stove-top is an AGA, which is unfamiliar to many, but fancy and fun! All instructions on how to use is provided in the app, at the house and from the owner.

There is a queen +bath on the lowest level, a second master + 3 additional queen rooms on the second level and a full+twin bunk on the third level.

Pros: The home was very well decorated, lots of seating areas inside and out. Beautiful outdoor patio off the kitchen with 2 large tables (outdoor dining was great). A wonderful 3rd story deck with a view of the capital building. Incredible bathrooms. Separate dining room and a kitchen island bar for informal eating. Huge refrigerator and freezer. Located about 1 mile from the convention center, CVS was 2 blocks away, HEB was about 1 mile. Lots of restaurants and food trucks just a few blocks away. The owner was incredibly responsive when we discovered that the hair dryers had gone missing and had several delivered to the house that same day. Basic kitchen items (cofee filters, salt, pepper and toiletries were provided.

Cons: The cons list are all minor things, thus we still gave a 5 star rating. No hangers in the closets, no iron or ironing board, no washer/dryer for when someone had a spill on their garment, no extra pillows or blankets no extra light bulbs when one blew.

In summary, we had a wonderful stay and would definitely consider staying here again.

We had 15 girls and everyone loved the house! It is a great size and can easily accomodate a group of this size and it is so much more fun for everyone to be under one roof rather than split up in different hotel rooms. The living room was perfect for a lingerie shower and the kitchen is a great size for everyone to congregate and make cocktails. The location is also ideal for going downtown, it was roughly a $10 uber ride to get to restaurants/bars. I would most definitely recommend renting this house for a long weekend with friends, we all had so much fun!

1372,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3165621#reviews,"Jan 20, 2015",5/5,Amazing centrally located home,"Our group of 14 had the pleasure of recently staying in this home and had a wonderful experience. We were all visiting from various parts of the country to attend a bachelorette party and could not have picked a better location. We were so central to everything and did not end up paying much throughout the trip in cab fare. The house held us comfortably with everyone securing a spot on a bed (one was on a blow up mattress provided by the house). The kitchen was amazing and we ended up spending most of our time gathered around the large island in the middle. I knew we would struggle with the oven after reading prior reviews, but we didn’t end up using the oven itself, only the stovetop which worked great. The bathrooms were also very adequately sized. Most of us would get ready in the spacious master bedroom bathroom and had a blast doing so.

I would definitely recommend this home to any larger visiting group. You truly will not be disappointed.

"
1373,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3165621#reviews,"Jan 1, 2015",3/5,Don't even try to cook,"First the good points: great location; killer view of downtown and the Capitol from lovely third-floor veranda; large and spacious rooms with lots of different spaces to gather in on all three floors; a first floor bedroom and bath for anyone who has trouble with stairs; in general, even better than the pictures show.

But then there are the not-so-good points, like one hanger (total) in a six bedroom house; no washer and drier, even though the listing says there are; and then the kitchen. The kitchen is beautiful: spacious, lots of counter space and cupboard space, and a coffee-maker, microwave, dishwasher, and ice-maker. But the kitchen has a woefully inadequate supply of glasses for a house that can easily accommodate 10 people, not a single bowl for cereal in the morning (there are a half-dozen mugs of the kind you get for free from various organizations- those can be pressed into service), and a completely inadequate stock of kitchen utensils if you want to do any cooking-- or, even if you don't, if you want to heat anything in the microwave.

But cooking is not recommended anyway, due to the Aga stove that the kitchen sports. I imagine that if you live with an Aga you get used to it and learn how to use it, but it is completely inappropriate for a rental where you want to be able to walk in and be able to cook up a simple meal. And if the Aga is not turned on when you arrive you can forget about even using it to heat up food (we'd planned to re-heat Franklin Barbeque procured earlier in the day) since it takes hours for the Aga to heat up. The Aga has no dials for either the ovens or the range top-- the different compartments and burners heat to pre-set approximate temperatures and you put your food where you think the right temperature is to cook it correctly. My daughter-in-law, who is not only a professionally trained chef, but is very intelligent and resourceful, was driven to distraction trying to make Christmas dinner on the thing.

(And, oh yes, there was an ant infestation in the kitchen.)

Our recommendation: sell the Aga (they are very expensive) and use the money to buy a regular stove; stock the kitchen with adequate plates, bowls, glasses, and utensils; and use the couple bucks left over to buy some hangers.

We've given the house three stars as an average: the house's good qualities are offset by the kitchen problems.

Lots of characteristics of an older home with all the amenities of a new home. The view from the third bedroom balcony was fabulous. My sister got married in Austin so the family elected to rent a house to stay together and this worked great. The house is in a transitional neighborhood so there are some beautiful homes next to smaller ones but the location to downtown made it ideal. We had nine people stay and the house absolutely could fit many more. The only thing I would warn about is that the oven, though very high end, if it isn't turned on, takes 4 hours to warm up so really don't plan on cooking anything. As this is a rental house most people would not even dream of cooking and really it was a small thing. The beds were all very comfortable, excellent decor, and overall great experience. The bride and groom even commented they would rather stay at the house then at their hotel suite because it was so nice. Would absolutely stay here again and worked great for us.

We came with 16 girls for my bachelorette party and we fit in perfectly, and could fit even more in - there were several couches, closets with air mattresses, and one of the rooms now has bunk beds. The house is built for this sort of situation - large common spaces, an awesome kitchen, the backyard, and the roof deck were all perfect for a social group. Though there were only 3 bathrooms, which was a worry initially, every bathroom is huge and allows people to be able to get ready while other people are showering - never an issue.

The fridge was broken during our weekend, but the manager was immediately aware of the situation and brought us ice and has been incredibly accommodating. Everything else went swimmingly!

Location-wise was definitely walkable although we typically took ubers which were super easy and very short rides.

None of us wanted to leave and wish we were still there! Thanks for a great weekend.

The house came as advertised and was in great condition when we arrived. The back patio area was a big hit, and even with 14 people in the house we did not feel like we were on top of each other. It is a great location, with $8 Uber rides to 6th and rainey streets.

We did have some minor issues with the kitchen. The oven is an ""always on or always off"" style AGA oven, which we requested to be kept on but it was off. We also weren't able to turn it on ourselves because the wick for the pilot light was not there. The refrigerator and freezer also did not work very well and did not do its job of keeping things cold. These issues were an inconvenience but we worked our way around them.

The owner/manager was available at all times for any questions we had and was very helpful in reminding us what we needed to bring and what would be provided. All in all I would definitely recommend this place, especially if you want to be close to downtown.

The quality, unique features, and great decor of the house made it such a fun place to be! From the motion-activated lighting along the stairs, to the comfortable mattresses, and fun decor, it's obvious that a lot of effort was put into this home. There was also a fridge and/or minifridge on every level, which was really nice. Space was defintiely not an issue - there were only 9 of us so many people had their own beds and we all slept extremely comfortably, with plenty of room for 6 more. The house was also very clean and well-maintained. Overall we just felt so at home being there.

The location is GREAT - the neighborhood felt like a safe, quiet area and you can catch a cab to anywhere downtown for under $10, which was great for us because we didn't have a car. (Cabs also usually got to the house within less than 10 minutes of calling, which was nice!) It was also easy walking distance from CVS and Franklin BBQ (which was SO worth the wait!). The view of the city from the top/back deck was great as well.

We were all first time visitors to Austin so planned to be out and about as much as possible, but we could have easily spent a couple days just hanging out in the house and in the big backyard!! But we did venture out to some other great places as well - 6th street at night was a blast, we also spent an afternoon on South Congress visiting all the unique shops. We had THE BEST brisket at Franklin BBQ, which is right around the corner from the house. It was about a 3 hour wait but 100% worth it - the brisket practically melts in your mouth! Would also recommend Chuy's if you're in the mood for some mexican/tex-mex - the food is amazing and the atmosphere is fun and laid back.

This is by far the nicest rental than any of us have stayed in. And I would 100% recommend this property to anyone and everyone who is looking for a place to stay in Austin!! This was WAY better and more comfortable than staying in a hotel, or any other rental for that matter!

There were plenty of private rooms for adults who like privacy: This worked well for not having to listen to snoring, early risers, or those who stayed up late. The two living areas with TVs flanking the kitchen worked perfectly for sports around family style meals. Welcoming guest on the front porch and swapping semi-factual stories around the fire pit were highlights of the trip.

This would also be the prefect home for a family gathering with the extended family. The layout is good for both the young and the young at heart (such as our group.)

Linens, baths, parking, appliances, and the host were all as they should be, great. The location was an easy walk to campus and the restaurants. We will be booking for next year.

This place had a huge open concept living area that was great for gathering my large group of guests. The best part was that each room had an on-suite bathroom that made each guest feel like they had their own oasis to go back to after a long day at the lake or out on the town. The house is also 1 block away from an amazing bakery/breakfast/coffee spot Texas Bread which had AWESOME sandwiches we catered for a day on the lake. It was easy to get taxi's to and from the lake, downtown and rainey street as well - about 5 minutes anywhere you want to go. We also walked to Torchy's Tacos- a must have in Austin!

She was there to meet me in person when we arrived and showed us around the house. There are very few instructions to know about, everything is very easy. The house itself, is huge and beautiful and very well furnished and modernly equipped, we never needed anything and were very comfortable. Parking is easy on the street and there is a bus stop just a block away to take you into town. We would definitely stay there again! It felt like home. It was really a lovely stay!

The only thing I can possibly think of that was not perfect was that one of the beds that was advertised as a futon ended up being a fairly thin mattress on the floor which was not very comfortable to sleep on (and there were 14 of us, so we needed every bed we could get) but all other beds and memory foam mattresses were awesome and that was honestly the only tiny complaint we had, everything else was above our expectations and I highly recommend Stacy's home :)

The house was even bigger and therefore more accommodating than originally thought. Plenty of bathrooms for the girls to get ready and plenty of beds. Great open spaces for everyone to come together and enjoy each others company and yet still spread out enough for naps to be had without disturbance! Walked to a great wine and tapas place called Vino Vino first night there (a little farther than expected but awesome spot). Sunday before heading out we were able to walk a very short distance to a yummy chill place called Ruby's BBQ and then had some AWESOME bloody Mary's at a fun and funky place called Trudy's. The only big issue we had was the transportation to 6th street as yellow cab was a real pain to deal with and many times wouldn't allow more than 4 or 5 in a 6 passenger van so usually half the group was 30 minutes earlier to a destination and in one case a group was stuck for hours without a way back to the house. We learned a little too late that booking a passenger van through Super Shuttle or something to at least get somewhere by a specific time is more conducive to a larger group. That being said, the homeowner Stacy was fantastic to work with all along the way and even left some beer, wine and snacks to welcome us. Would definitely recommend this rental to anyone visiting the Austin area with a large group.

We usually stay in the South Congress area (Bouldin or Travis Heights). The ""Hill House"" is by far the best place we've ever found and we look forward to visiting again next year.

This two bedroom/one bath cottage has enough space for us and room for guests to visit during our stay. It's well appointed with all the conveniences one might ever want. The back yard is great for our pet cat to explore and the large vacant lot behind the house (which belongs to Carol and Kerry) provides even more space for her to explore. The steep driveway is an adventure too, but difficult to walk.

Carol and Kerry are kind and attentive land lords who were there to help/cat sit when we were called away for a family emergency. And the location -- all of Bouldin is great (a mix of worker cottages like this house and California modernism in-fill) but here you're just a short walk to the El Mercado (yes we did see Bill Kirchen at Mystery Mondays), food trucks and fine dining (e.g. Sway) on S 1st, a short bike ride to Guero's and the Continental Club on South Congress, or to ABGB on Oltorf for some Sunday afternoon dancing, or to the Saxon Pub on South Lamar, or to Lady Bird Lake where you can explore the trails (find the ""Beltway"" and learn about Texas music) and seek out the ""Sacred Waters of Barton Springs"" in Zilker Park.

We would not hesitate to recommend Carol & Kerry, this property or others they offer ""Under the Texan Sun"" to those looking for an Austin adventure.

Ps. we like to visit in the weeks before SXSW. The city and the rents go crazy during the festival. Austin can be cool in February, but there's no snow to shovel!

There was a cold snap during our stay - Carole and Kerry were always quick to message with updates on the weather. The house is nicely outfitted for kiddos with a few toys and the cold nights turned into family Yahtzee as board games and video entertainment are quickly accessible if you're not up for walking to the many eateries surrounding the area.

The bedrooms and living room couch were comfortable and we had plenty of space one evening for a night-in, amidst our other nights going out.

We loved the area for all the wackiness nearby: Murals, fun little shops and food trucks. We were also a long walk or short Fasten (like Uber or Lyft) away from many places, so nothing was really out of reach. From this place, we were able to explore Zilker Park, downtown, and Rainey street, among others.

The Wifi and TV worked well with instructions on how to use. I was so impressed by how well-stocked the bathroom was. [Good] Shampoo and Conditioner already in there, extra toothbrushes for those that forgot theirs, and even static guard! Bags supplied for grocery shopping (which we used).

I just wish we could have had more time to take advantage of their cozy backyard... Next time! All in all, the place was CLEAN, updated and very comfortable. Houses like these exceed the standard and what I hope for each time I use VRBO.

The ONLY issue we ran into that weekend was that we ran out of toilet paper on the last day. Had it been earlier in the trip, I am sure Carole or Kerry would have helped us out. First world problems!

Our accommodations and location could not have been more perfect!! Carole was very quick to respond to all of my questions before arrival and provided all the baby gear we needed (pack n play, highchair, and stroller) for a successful and stress free trip. The house is walking distance to so many great places to eat and shops! We had everything we needed, and didn't want to leave! We will be back for sure.

1449,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p321912vb#reviews,"Jan 10, 2017",5/5,Hill House is a great way to experiece true Austin.,"My daughter and I decided to stay at Hill House from my cousin's recommendation. He stayed at Hill House last winter, so this year we gave it a try. GREAT IDEA! Hill House is within walking distance of coffee shops, restaurants, food trucks and parks. This is a very safe neighborhood. The house came fully furnished with comfortable bedding, couches, indoor and out door furnishings. The cozy backyard is very private and a great way to relax and barbecue with friends or family. Dog friendly.

 Carole provided many reference books and flyers to help you learn about Austin better. The walk to downtown Austin is quite doable and there is miles of great shopping, sight seeing, restaurants and cozy Hotels to lounge at. Check out the courtyard at Hotel San Jose.

 Mostly, Carole is a most delightful hostess and she is always willing to answer questions or share her expertise on Austin or the neighborhood. She made the booking of Hill House most accommodating. She is a telephone call away at all times.

I give Hill House was just the getaway we had hoped for. It is a safe neighborhood where you get the best of Austin neighborhood and city living. So now, I pass the recommendation on to you. Hill House is a five star getaway! Peggy G.

1451,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p321912vb#reviews,"Nov 15, 2016",5/5,"Clean, comfortable and convenient!","My husband, tiny dog and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Hill House. The house was clean and tastefully decorated with comfortable furnishings, modern appliances, and plenty of space. The yard was more than adequate for a dog 'relief area' early in the morning and late at night outside 'walking hours'. Great little park across the street too which made dog walks very pleasant. Easy walk to food trucks and a number of restaurants on First. Our favorites within walking distance- Torchy's Tacos and Gourdough's Donuts (Fat Elvis was OMG! delicious) food trucks and Polvos Restaurant. A short drive south on First to Taqueria Arandas yielded a fabulous casual meal as well.

Other attractions: Zilker Park has a WONDERFUL off leash area for well behaved dogs. It's 25 acres but not fenced, so a good recall is needed. (10 minute drive away) Franklin BBQ - Worth the 3 hour wait. In fact, the wait is part of the adventure. 6th Street - Bars and music galore. Most start relatively late, but we found great music on a Thursday night at 7:30 pm. so even early birds can find entertainment.

The house is conveniently located as well -- short drive to downtown or to any of the highways. A left turn to go north onto First from Gibson proved VERY difficult at many times of the day, so if heading north I recommend taking Bouldin to Barton Springs to First instead where a traffic signal helps with the left turn. Saved us some frustration once we figured out that routing, and let us stay in the relaxed ATX mode.

Carole communicated well with me before and during our stay - She's a pleasure to deal with. We'd love to stay there again if we return to Austin in the future and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to friends and family.

Even right down to the room darkening shades in the bedrooms - helps you get a good nights sleep (priceless when traveling). The location is perfect! I even walked to the convention center while there for a conference one day. The house is perched on a hill with lots of trees around it for privacy. Friends tell me the cell phone signal quality was fantastic (because of being on a hill I suppose). All the instructions for the home were easy to understand & included labels on switches (thank you). I will definitely stay here again when business or pleasure leads me back to Austin.

The beds were comfortable, and we were grateful for the use of the sofa sleeper (also surprisingly comfortable), as it allowed our two children to each have their own bed. We also loved having a washer & dryer, and appreciated the little thoughtful touches - coffee, tea, seasonings in the kitchen, and sewing kit/ toiletries in the bathroom.

They had a good TV room and so many shows (DVDs) to pick from. They had a really good kitchen and perfect washing machines. A dozen swimming holes were close-by (a 10-20 minute drive) and one of the best ones was McKinney Falls. It was a fun walk to the water (Town Lake) where we had lots of fun.

She also provided a children's wading pool in the backyard so our boys could splash and play while we relaxed in the evenings. (Our boys enjoyed it so much that they started crying when it was time to pack up and go home)

The house was perfect for us and we spent several evenings just walking around the neighborhood with the boys in their stroller. El Mercado Mexican Restaurant was a 2 minute walk from the house and had great food and a play area for kids. Food trucks were just across the street.

Carole and Kerry have thought of everything in order to create a lovely stay at their beautiful home. It was rainy, so we spent a lot of time indoors, and were very comfy either reading on the couch, sitting at the high-top kitchen table dining and watching the rain on the trees outside, or watching some fun movies on their cable TV. Once it cleared we were able to adventure around the neighborhood, and just a few blocks away (easy walk!) is the cool ""SoCo"" (South Congress) area with plenty of fun restaurants, bars, and boutique shops (and vintage shops galore!). We wish we had more time to spend there, but it was our last day, and our only sunny one. I took several walks around the immediate neighborhood, which is safe and lovely and filled with friendly dog walkers and families strolling. Just a quick car-hop away is downtown Austin, with the famous 6th street music scene as well as a Whole Foods to die for! Hill House truly is in an ideal location. And Carole went above and beyond ""landlord"" status when she took calls from my flu-ridden friend and referred us to her local doctor, who was fantastic! Both Kerry and Carole contacted us several times to make sure all our needs were met. We felt extremely well taken care of, in our little Texas Paradise.

We had fun playing with the board games in the living room, watching movies after a day out doing ""touristy"" things in Austin.

Every place we wanted to visit was a short drive away. Even the drive to Lake Travis wasn't bad at all, we also visited the Thinkery, the botanical gardens and Barton Springs (a warning: the water is ice cold!).

We also ordered in food from the many excellent restaurants that deliver to this area and had lazy afternoons just hanging out. The neighborhood is beautiful and the house is on a quiet street so no cars honking horns or loud neighbors.

Last but not least, I specially liked the trees and different plants surrounding the house and landscaping the yard. Also, a pleasant surprise was to find a walking trail right across the street.

It's not its amenities (which are fabulous--uber-equipped kitchen, comfortable beds, spotless bathroom). It's not the property layout (which is amazing--front deck for morning coffee and back deck for evening libations PLUS an entire extra yard for catch with your dog!). It's not the ""extras"" for which there is no charge (super reliable WiFi, lots of games, those little toiletries I always forget like a nail file). What makes staying at Hill House perfection is the personal service you get from Carole and Kerry. From the second I contacted them until the day after I left when they offered to mail the slippers we had left behind, dealing with Carole and Kerry was a consummate pleasure. I have rented via VRBO for years, both internationally and here in the States, and this has truly been one of the most personal experiences for which I could ask. Renting Hill House wasn't like renting a house from a stranger--I felt like I was staying at my ""cousin Carole's"" place and that she knew just what we needed to have a fabulous time. Our trip involved some special circumstances and Carole and Kerry made sure that everything was taken care of. Even though Austin is one of the great foodie cities of the world, our situation warranted lots of down time just chilling at the house and it more than met the challenge. We cooked a number of great feasts but also were able to walk to extraordinary dining (Elizabeth St, South Congress Café, Torchy's, Home Slice, HopDaddy's). But mostly we just sat around the living room and the backyard laughing, story-telling, and playing games. Carole provided us with a set up for our Christmas tree and then checked to make sure we were okay. We have stayed in Austin quite a few times over the holidays.

Everything is decorated so cute and homey with so many little details that you can't get from a hotel. The kitchen is beautiful with everything you could ever need! If it wasn't for torchy's tacos down the street, we probably would have used the kitchen more :). We couldn't have been happier with the location either. We didn't rent a car and had no problem getting around by bus.

Carole was SO helpful and accommodating through the whole process. She even sent a few emails with groupon's and ideas of what to do in Austin. I bragged about her to all our friends and family staying in hotels for the wedding.

We will definitely stay here again if we return to Austin and would recommend this home to anyone. Thank you so much Carole for making our stay so memorable!

Carol welcomed us to Austin with her helpful and friendly demeanor, and pulled out all the stops for our stay-- a fully stocked (and very clean!) kitchen, a Pac N Play and high chair for our baby, new restaurant reviews-- even fresh coffee beans! Not to mention, the house comes with a new front-loading washer and dryer, 2 roomy and light bedrooms, great front, side and back decks and is in one of the best locations in town- Bouldin Creek is charming and hip, within walking distance to Elizabeth Street Cafe, Sway, El Chili and Torchy's Tacos (all delicious!) You are also within walking distance to the hike and bike trail downtown and great shopping on SOCO. We were already booking our next stay before we left! Next time, we are coming for 3 weeks with our dog. Did I mention there's a huge back lot for your pet to run around or just hang out in the shade? Highly recommend!

This house was absolutely perfect for the occasion! My nieces and nephew raved about the house, that it was so clean, comfortable and well-appointed. They were all ready to move in for good. The location was not far from the other 2 houses we rented and the other places everyone wanted to visit. The deck was great for sitting out and enjoying the evenings. The owners were very attentive, but not intrusive and proved flexible on some last minute schedule adjustments. We would definitely rent this house (and the other 2) again!

This was our first visit to Austin - and our first family vacation - and we couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. The location is ideal, especially for first-time visitors. We quickly found our bearings in Austin because we were able to walk to so many destinations, including the food trailers on 1st Street, South Congress, and Zilker Park. The house is located in a great neighborhood with a beautiful park and creek across the street. We enjoyed our many walks and explorations together.

The house itself is impeccable and so comfortable. It is perfect for a family with a young child. We appreciated that the house was one level and that our daughter could move so easily from room to room. She also loved playing in the fenced-in back yard. The amenities are wonderful, and Carole really went above and beyond to make sure our needs were met. She provided us with a pack and play, high chair, and umbrella stroller, which definitely made our travels easier. Both the kitchen and bathroom are stocked with the essentials of home and this helped us settle in immediately so we could begin enjoying everything Austin has to offer!

Our visit was truly a memorable one thanks to the personal attention Carole offered us, beginning with the very first email I sent her and continuing beyond our last day at the house. She provided us with information about Austin before we arrived, which definitely helped us plan our trip. And the house has a binder of information, along with many guidebooks and magazines, which were invaluable resources to us while we were there. Carole called to check in on us during our stay and immediately responded to requests for directions, recommendations, etc. We felt so at home during our stay in Austin and we can't wait to return to this special city and this special house. I highly, highly recommend a stay here!

First, including the famous ""Torchy's"". The house was very clean and had every amenity, including a washer and dryer, modern kitchen, inviting living room with nice TV (and a good collection of DVDs) and two bedrooms with comfortable beds. Outside there were two decks and a small backyard with picnic table and lounge chairs. Carole and Kerry were great hosts and were responsive to any request or question we had. It was perfect for us.

We always take our 4 legged son, Charlie, a beautiful well behaved German Shepherd with us, so our vacation lodging/dining are around him and pet friendly places. I decided to rent this cozy home instead of the usual pet friendly hotel. It was the best decision I made in a long time. The house has everything any home has. The kitchen provides with spices, dinner ware, silver wear, zip loc bags, paper towels, pans, microwave, stove/oven, full fridge - EVERYTHING. Even though we really did not cook during our stay, we still took advantage of the ammenities in the kitchen. There are two bedrooms with comfy beds and a very comfortable sectional sleeper sofa in living room. The best parts are the spacious backyard which provided our pooch with plenty of room to roam and exercise. It also has these pretty terraces which can be enjoyed at any time with even a bbq to grill stuff. The house is located in a very attractive area, within walking distance to South Congress ave. and downtown. The neighborhood is very quiet and safe. We walked all around it late in the evening and were able to observe the beautiful homes in the area, each with its unique decor and arquitecture. If you want to explore Austin in a more ""local way"", this is the way to go. Carole was so helpful from day one. She quickly replied to my many questions my email and phone. She was at the property to greet us and welcomed us with a yummy bottle of wine and the best bone for Charlie. Trust me when I say that I am picky, and this is the best and ONLY way for us to return to Austin. Thank you Carole for making our time during the holidays 2012 one to remember for ever.

My friends and I wanted to celebrate a birthday in town, rather than driving into Austin and back out to south Austin every night. We were pleased with our stay, and most importantly our location.

This little bungalow is nestled on a quiet side street in a great neighborhood. We began each morning with an exploration of the residential streets on our way to one of the numerous local cafes. (Beware lack of sidewalks though.) There is a park across the street with swings, and through some woods we found an enchanted rocky creek - hence the name bouldin creek neighborhood.

Soft, human-friendly leather sectional in the living room means total comfort AND you don't have to worry about your dog leaving hair on the side as he lays at your feet. It also means that, if you don't have dogs, you'll never know there were ever any in the property.

We've stayed at many vacation homes in the Austin area s we looked at the area for relocating and searched for a permanent home. This is one of the best places at a great value with experienced owner/managers who are extremely accommodating. Highly recommended.

It's quiet, beautiful, yet just around the corner from all that Austin has to offer, Town Lake (now call lady Bird Lake) and it's wonderful Hike and Bike trail, Zilker Park, Barton Springs natural pool, the bats under congress Ave., downtown, the eclectic South Congress area, and lots of wonderful places to eat. If you want to experince the culture of Austin, this is the place. The house is set up so nicely and even with the hot Texas summer weather we enjoyed the two outdoor seating areas and the grill.

Everything we wanted to do was such a short drive from the house... we would have walked to many places but the weather was too hot during our stay. The house was fully stocked with all the comforts of home, and then some. We also really appreciated the fact that they had a high chair and pack-n-play for us to use.

The cottage itself is very comfortable and cute. And our hosts were lovely and really made sure we had everything we needed – down to a baby blanket, play pack and high-chair for my 11-month old daughter. My 3 boys – ages 3, 5 and 7 – loved the house and the well-planned outdoor seating areas.

We enjoyed all the attractions close by: watching the bats under the South Congress Bridge, swimming and picnicing at Barton Springs/Zilker Park, playing in the fountains at Butler Park, and going to the museums downtown. We also had a great time cooking out on the BBQ and just lounging around the cottage.

And thanks to the high speed Internet connection I was able to get some work done as well.

We will definitely be back – a great place for a relaxing and fun family holiday!

To begin, our reservation process was extremely easy and were greeted with prompt responses by Carole, the owner. She also corresponded quickly during our stay.

The cottage is only a stone throw away from the Lady Bird lake which has a great view of the downtown. Under the summer heat, it could be a hot walk, but it's very enjoyable. If you own dogs, this cottage has the perfect backyard for your 4-legged friends. It also has a very classy patio that is separated by a fence that encapsulates the patio dining furnitures which came with a big umbrella and two lounge chairs for those who like to lay under the sun.

The cottage has 2 bedrooms that come with fresh linens and 1 bathroom that comes with shampoo, conditioner and bathing gel. There is a comfy couch with plenty of seating space in the living room which has a pull out bed. Though we didn't use much of the TV or DVD player, the owner has provided tons of DVDs for both adults and kids to watch. There are also lots of boardgames. We used the iPod player quite a bit. The bathroom is a bit small, but for a short stay and 3 people in the house, not a problem at all.

If you are up for some breakfast tacos, take a short walk or drive to the Trailer Park and Eatery which is on South First Street and then bring them back to the patio to enjoy!

I highly recommend staying at the cottage. We look forward to coming back.

The home was equipped with everything you need. We especially enjoyed the yard being fenced for our dogs. We enjoyed walking around the neighborhood & the park and trail across the street were especially a nice treat. Carole was the perfect hostess. She checked on us to make sure we arrived OK and if we needed anything. We found no matter where you ate, the food was always fresh and tasty. Even Torchy's food truck for breakfast tacos. We came to visit the 33rd annual Pecan Festival. Very much enjoyed the festival, food, scenery, and drinks during our short visit. We will definitely come back. A must to visit is Salt Lick. About 25 minutes away, but the food is great. We found out they do not have a liquor license yet, so BYOB is available. Music downtown, many places within walking distance from each other. Visit S. Congress shops also, many up and down the street. Great food and house margaritas at Iron Cactus with an awesome rooftop patio to people watch. For another view of the Austin area, just about 15 minutes from the house is Mt. Bonnell. A nice climb, awesome views. If you want, a great place to have a snack or picnic. Overall, we were very satisfied and only wish we could of stayed longer. We will return. Thank you Carole for helping us celebrate the weekend.

The owners were incredibly accommodating and even found a high chair and a pack and play for our infant to use. The location was superb. We walked to the South Congress district many times as well as to Barton Springs. The small park across the street was perfect for our friend's 3 year-old. I highly recommend this property and would go back there in a heartbeat! The outdoor space, both front and back, was such a treat! This property will exceed your expectations!

It's important to note that we never used our cars the whole time, and everything was within close walking distance. The walks through the interesting neighborhoods with art-filled, architecturally interesting sights, are a must-see. The first night, we cooked in the fully functional gas gourmet kitchen, and used the luxury Weber gas grill on the 1st deck adjacent to the kitchen. The following morning we walked through a beautiful neighborhood park, the neat trailhead directly outside the front door, and found Torchy's Taco's for breakfast (you've gotta see this place). In our 4 night stay, we walked to music venues, neighborhood bars, excellent restaurants, and funky shops, all within minutes on foot, all while enjoying the interesting quiet neighborhoods that border the house. The home is as comfortable as possible, with luxury bedding and beds, linens, and every convenience, while still retaining it's true Bungalow character. We marveled at the fit and finish of both the interior and exterior, with gourmet range and stove, the most comfortable leather sleep sectional we've ever seen, an iPhone-ready sound system, and 3 deck/patio areas complete with comfortably shaded seating areas, completely private while still being right downtown. This home is QUIET, which was a welcome surprise, considering we could see downtown skyscrapers through the windows! The cool outside fenced backyard, with crushed pink granite, flagstone walkways, and huge live-oak and elm canopies, was our favorite place to enjoy the outdoors. The home is perched on a private corner lot, with amazing lanscaping, all of which provides beautiful views through the windows, while providing the home with privacy. You won't want to close the blinds, it's so pretty. We really could go on forever about this place, but words and pictures really don't do it justice. Having stayed literally hundreds of nights in our favorite city, both as residents and travelers, we can honestly say that this was our favorite of all time, including downtown hotels, other vacation rentals, and even our own home in Travis Heights. Congratulations, Carole and Kerry! Well done!

So is shopping and many other activities and places of interest. Whole Foods, Waterloo Records, and Book People are all just over the river and Zilker Park is minutes away.

But the access is only one of the great things about this house. The owners are wonderful and helpful, providing specialty items if needed (e.g., a paella pan and electric mixer). The house itself is stylish, comfortable, excellently equipped, and feels quickly like a home. The outside space is equally well furnished and whether you want privacy or to watch the activity on the quiet street, there is a spot to hang out. The neigbourhood is quiet, there is a park across the street, and the landscaping suits the environment of Austin perfectly.

We has an entry code (unique to us) making for easy arrival and checkout, and more secure than a usual lock and key system. The kitchen is well equipped, there is a new outdoor grill, and nice places to sit outside. The owner was attentive and prompt, calling before and during our stay to make sure everything was going well. She even provided a turkey pan and some Thanksgiving paper plates and napkins. The location made it perfect for our three day stay, and easy for all the fun adventures we had in Austin. We went downtown, to several University museums, to Zilker Park, Barton Springs, S. Congress Street, the football game, and many excellent restaurants. We had a car, but taxi rides to most places would be convenient from the cottage. When I looked for the house using an online map it showed the house next door which is ok, but not as nice. What a nice surprise to drive up to a perfectly cared for home.

The street was very quiet and we were so surprised that we could actually catch a glimpse of downtown from the house. The food trailers were truly within a very short walking distance (perfect with a 5 and 8 year old in tow on their scooters) as well as our favorite SoCo shops and restaurants.

We will most definitely be back when the weather warms up again. We were shocked at how close we were to Barton Springs and all that that particular area offers.

A cozy house on a hill, surrounded by large live oaks in the heart of Austin's eclectic action.

We felt immediately welcomed in the space which is an elegant yet simple environment. The colors are warm and tasteful and the furnishings are handsome.

The kitchen is spacious and adequately equipped to make everything from fresh ground coffee to a gourmet meal. On the side porch we grilled a Salmon & Vege feast that we ate in the private courtyard located just outside the kitchen.. The dishes are colorful and there is an array of great serving bowls and platters, as well as very nice wine glasses to use.

The beds are inviting and incredibly comfortable. Both nights we slept with the windows ajar welcoming cool fresh Austin air.

The art selections lent a special touch throughout the house - and we loved the curved leather couch which had not only a recliner but also a sleeper couch. Games, a decent DVD selection, Bose Speaker Dock and wireless internet connections made us feel right at home.

The owners were very helpful in making us feel welcomed and gave great ideas on making our stay fun and comfortable.

Across the street is a park - so one day we walked the trail through the park that led us to S. 1st Street. Across the street is a Trailer Eatery - with Torchy's Tacos and an unique hotdog stand named ""Man Eats Dog"" with a great selection of various types of hot dogs. We ordered a lamb dog called ""Big Fat Greek Dog"". Served with a yogurt dressing, onions, black olives in a lightly toasted tender bun. It was a winner!

On Saturday we took a longer walk to explore the area. Down the street about 8 blocks South,we turned West onto W. Mary. A Fair Trade Coffee shop in the area, as well as a Rock Castle someone built (fun to look at), unique front yards and homes from another era, along with super modern buildings. If you love architecture you will love the W. Mary walk.

We settled on El Reyna's on S. 1st for breakfast and enjoyed the Huevos Rancheros served with a red sauce and a tomatillo sauce, refried beans and delicious potatoes. We dined on the patio painted with fun green frogs playing musical instruments. And the coffee there was brewed to perfection.

SInce we cook a lot and don't eat out much, the little kitchen was perfectly adequate and being so close to Whole Foods made it all very convenient.

The condo is very clean and modern. We had everything we needed and more. If we hadn't been so busy at the conference, I would've liked to hang out there more. There are two TVs with cable, but there's no TV guide channel - and let's face it there's not much good stuff on TV anyway- so we just watched stuff on our computer. The wifi worked without incident.

For those into shopping, there's the following also within walking distance (1-2 blocks):

The location was perfect - close enough to the ""party"" without being in the middle of it. If you're a fan of Whole Foods - then, you'll be in foodie heaven. The flagship store is a little more than two blocks away. Austin - good music, good food, clean/safe townhouse rental - what else can you ask for? Brandy was/is always responsive and kind.

The accomodations were excellent - nicely decorated with bedding, bathrooms (extra towels and toiletries), and the kitchen fully equipped for all of our needs. The living room had plenty of seating and the wifi was nice to have (without extra charge). Restaurants were within steps of the condo (loved Z Tejas) and it was nice to have a parking place where we could come and go without extra charge. We've stayed at local hotels in the past and were charged for all of these 'added amenities'. I would highly recommend this condo to anyone who is going to visit Austin for both business and pleasure. Thanks so much!

You can simultaneously feel you are ""away from it all"" while you are just steps away from all the action of the city. The Whole Foods flagship store is a 3 minute walk away for the newspaper, coffee, pastries, excellently prepared meals for any time of the day. We stayed a month and came up with a reason to visit every day. Our favorite nearby restaurants - Clark's, Z tejas, 24 Diner, Bacon, Counter Cafe and Win Flo and Josie's (all walkable); Josephine House (longish walk/short drive; Elizabeth Street Cafe, Uchi's, Uchico, Lamberts, la Condessa, Stubbs. Austin is blessed with many great restaurants and the owners will give you good advice. We contracted with Robert ""Bassman"" Brown for 3 different fishing trips (recommend). Day trips to Gruen and Fredericksburg are worth the effort. Very nicely refurbished LBJ Library should not be missed. You can fish or walk the trail of LBJ lake and Shoal Creek parkway on either side of you. Great galleries and shopping within walking distance. A funky antique store (Fortney) doors down - ask for James. Purchased a fabulous cowhide there. Wish I was still there! This condo is definitely the place to be.

One of the things that I was impressed with immediately was how clean the condo is, as well as being decorated tastefully and smelling great as well! Another thing we enjoyed was the location. Being able to walk to so many things was wonderful. And Brandy, you were right. Ztejas rocks! great food!

Renters should know that there is a 15% tax on the condo which was not listed at the time of the review. Be sure to grab a copy of the bus schedule for the evenings and visit all the food places within walking distance in the mean time.

We especially loved waking up to the gentle chirping of birds and our visits with Linus the adorably sweet neighbor kitty, wonderful respites from the stress of planning the big day! The separate entrance offered lots of privacy so we didn’t feel as though we were “intruding”, as some places can make one feel. Instructions and restaurant suggestions were aptly placed on the mini fridge, everything was very clean, and the beds/sheets were soft and comfy.

"
1661,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p325002#reviews,"Oct 16, 2013",5/5,"Quiet, Cozy, Comfortable","What a great stay! First off, the neighborhood is a small, quiet inlet, although still in central Austin and only 10 minutes away from downtown. The house is overlooking the green belt on Shoal Creek, which my wife and I found to be very enjoyable to walk around.

The house itself is like an art installation on the outside. The entire front walkway is lined with hundreds of different kinds of rocks (I guess she's a geologist?), and there is a fence with these wooden slats attached to it that you can flip back and forth. Entering the suite from the side of the house next to the giant water storage tank, I came into the main bedroom, which featured a comfy queen size bed, a tv with cable, a couch and coffee table, a remote-controlled AC unit, some drawers, a minifridge, coffee maker, mini toaster, and a not insubstantial set of glasses and plates. The decorations were interesting without being overbearing. The other bedroom is smaller and more sparse, but it still has a main double bed and a single mattress to pull out if necessary, as well as an old-fashioned writing desk and stocked bookshelf with lots of old children's books. The bathroom was probably the most colorful bathroom I've ever been in, full of vibrant red and blue and orange and green, and it had some cool twisty lights. The shower had very high water pressure, too, although the ceiling was a little short (I'm 6'3).

The owner, Janie, was very nice (she lived in the main part of the house, separate from the suite). She kept the place very clean. Next time we're in Austin, we'll be sure to come back. A great stay all around!

"
1662,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p325002#reviews,"Oct 1, 2013",5/5,A very comfortable space & 15mins to everything,"From the walk up to the grounds, this space is very inviting. The fence & walk way is so creative that it helped the transition from everyday to vacation mode. You enter through one of the two bed rooms, furnished with a TV, couch and a large (King?) bed, small fridge. The decor is energetic without being over bearing. This room is larger than most double bed hotel rooms. From this area you walk into a small 5 ft hall way that links the bathroom and other bed room. The bathroom is truly amazing. It’s so roomy that three people could brush their teeth in there comfortably. The bathtub is standard with shower head; however, the high pressure in this shower is incredible. You’re sure to be clean after a wash. The third bed room is smaller and does not have a TV or couch but it has a large selection of books which resonated with the book lover in me. The furniture was all wood and I felt like I was in a small cottage.

Janie, the home owner, keeps this space fully stocked with all amenities i.e. shampoo, conditioner, toilet paper. She even provides wine glasses!! I’m sure I’m leaving a lot out but I didn’t want for anything while staying here. We met Janie the first day. She was very nice and polite. She even washed our towels when I asked midweek. I couldn’t ask for a better hostess. Just to be clear, these rooms are separate from her main living space.

This is a perfect stay for anyone that wants to discover Austin. This location is 15 min or less to any part you want to visit; green belt, 6th street, south Austin – it’s perfect. Mind you, we rented a car.

I would defiantly stay here again if I get the chance. Thank you Janie! (Love, Eva, Michael, Mike & Diana)

The property was well maintained and it was one of those places where you feel like you are at home because you are very comfortable. there was also a small park right across the street that my family and i were able to go to and walk our dogs, that had poop bags and a trash close by. the inside was nicely decorated with a cable tv and she provided toiletries. there was also a mini fridge, coffee maker and dishes to use if needed. There was only one issue i dealt with which wasn't big deal but a bit annoying; her side door sticks really bad. So sometimes it was easy to open and other times it was really hard to open. Other than that i would have to say we really enjoyed our stay and will definitely be returning. i will also be recommending this place to my friends. Thanks Janie for the pleasant stay!

There is also an extensive collection of books, games, and records - a nice break from phone and computer screens - that helped make this feel like a true retreat! The neighborhood is quiet, but very close to Lamar Street where we visited several restaurants and bars. The vibe is funky but chill, and felt very ""Austin"" without the craziness of downtown and the 6th St. area (where we'd planned to go, but ended up changing our minds once we saw what was nearby!).

The boys, 1 & 3 had a wonderful time especially in the big swinging chair, and investigating the bamboo area.

Everything you possibly could have needed was there down to milk and sugar for the coffee. The owner stayed in touch with us before and throughout our stay and answered our minor questions almost immediately via email. The house is super charming and very ""Austin"" in decor and feels like you are in your own oasis while only being blocks from all the fun on South Lamar! The hot tub and outdoor shower were great.

It's often of higher quality and lower prices than booking hotels. We booked the Austinite B for a recent four day stay. First of all the contacts for the property are the best I've dealt with in terms of keeping us informed. We had almost daily emails starting about a week prior to our stay and throughout our visit. They kept us up to date on the amenities the property provided and on places to eat/play nearby.

The property was very nice. It's an older unit than has considerable updates. There is plenty of space for up to two couples. There is a full kitchen and washer/dryer so you could easily stay for an extended period. We really liked the deck area and spent a lot of time enjoying the warm weather. We had planned to use the hot tub, but never got around to it. It's in an ideal location that affords plenty of privacy, but it really needs a new cover. Just the appearance of the cover gives you pause about using it. That's really the only reason I went with four stars on the property.

The property is within walking distance to South Lamar so there are dining options nearby. The neighborhood is pretty quiet and safe. We have already decided to stay here during our next visit to Austin.

He gave us tons of information that was helpful in planning our trip, and our contact Sarah was very proactive in making sure we had everything we needed. The place itself feels neither high end nor trashy, it's just right: clean, airy, just right. I really appreciated how well-stocked the tiny kitchen was, both with pantry staples and kitchen equipment. (I was especially happy to find an aeropress, my preferred coffee maker--along with a standard percolator and a french press. And a grinder!) The only thing I would change is, better lighting in the living room! It was so dim after dark that I couldn't work on the puzzle we brought. Only my kids' eyes were good enough.

Location cannot be better. Close to downtown, Zilker Park, many of the attractions and tons of great eateries. Perfect location to have a productive business trip along with a fun time. It is filled with high end amenities. Anything and everything you need, from soap and lotion to wine bottle openers, grocery bags to umbrellas, you will find it there. Their attention to details is amazing. The balcony in Heart House is an added attraction for me. Looking out into the greenery, the tall brightly lit Christmas tree---all add to the festivities.

I am so glad that we chose them over a regular chain hotel. We were in town for the Waterman's Paddle for Humanity event over at the Texas Rowing Center and stayed ""The Heart House,"" which was maybe 10 minutes away. Nestled in a nice, tree-lined, ""hilly,"" quiet neighborhood, the location was also convenient to tons of restaurants and bars, grocery stores and more. Many places were within walking distance, including a place to drop into Barton Springs creek and multiple trails, and a very short drive from Zilker Park. The unit itself was as fantastic as the location. It was a small 1 bed/1 bath apartment complete with full kitchen, living and dining areas, fireplace, parking spot and large balcony with views of the hills. Although we didn't use the grill, we did take advantage of the patio table and chairs for our morning coffee and breakfast. We didn't cook there at all, but had everything to do so if we wanted to. They even had spices, Saran wrap, foil and Ziploc baggies, which came in handy. We had a real coffee pot and not one of those tiny 4-cup things you get in hotel rooms, and whole bean coffee that we ground with the provided grinder. Jay and Cynthia thought of everything down to the umbrella in case it rained, the Whole Foods branded shampoo/conditioner and shower gel, many books and magazines to read, games to play, and a nice variety of DVDs. When we originally booked, it was just going to be the two of us, but had to bring my boyfriend's 12 year-old twins at the last minute, so the fold out in the living room was a plus! All in all, we had a wonderful time and felt like were in a home away from home during our stay. The only thing I would have liked is a w/d, but since it was a short trip, it was an issue. For me personally, this unit might be a little too cozy for four people, especially if you stay longer than a weekend. It's just hard for me to share a bathroom with three other people. Nonetheless, we made do and have no complaints. A couple friends who frequent Austin stopped by on our last day and we showed them around and told them how great Jay and Cynthia were to work with. They'll be calling Zilker Vacations on their next Austin trip and so will we! Thank you for helping make our weekend that much more fun!

We wanted a private, quiet place that was easy to get to, but close to it all, and with a kitchen. The Heart House was PERFECT, from start to finish (excluse the pun!).

We arrived in the evening and didn't have to mess with checking in - just punched in the code on the lock box, got the keys and right in we went. Even though we never met the owners, they were always a phone call away -- they even offered to give us a ride to the race on Sunday at 6AM! We zipped right into our own reserved parking spot, steps from our front door. We were welcomed to a clean, funky condo decorated with hearts ... even the paper towels had hearts on them! The space was well appointed with clean towels, shampoo, utensils, etc. and a remote-controlled fireplace. We LOVED the coffee beans and grinder waiting for us - nice to have coffee your first morning without having to go to the grocery store! We made eggs in the morning, watched news on the HDTV, and poured though the ample travel brochures to plan our day's adventure.

The Heart House location is IDEAL. it overlooks Zilker Park, which has a botanical garden, sculpture garden, great running paths and tons of things for kids (train ride!). We were just minutes from great tex/mex/bbq restaurants, bike shops and shopping along Barton Springs Road, a 5-minute drive from the 6th street nighlife (GREAT LIVE MUSIC), and about 7 minutes to Travis Heights. You MUST pay a visit to Travis Heights before you leave Austin. Great funky shops, live outdoor music, restaurants, even the Trailer Park Taco Stands .. too funny. We sat at the bar at Wahoos and ate a pile of homemade tex/mex food. Great place.

If you're coming in from Bergstrom Airport, we advise - don't even need to mess with the highway and traffic. Just hop on Riverside Drive and you're about 15 minutes and a straight shot to your condo.

Unfortunately we brought the rain with us from Cleveland, but on a nice day you could sit and enjoy the great coffee on the deck, among the trees, overlooking Zilker.

Everything about the Heart House was great. It's not luxurious, so if you have high end taste, well maybe think twice. But we kinda felt like this was our first apartment together or something, and had a very romantic, relaxing and carefree stay.

Fortunately, I found Heart House!

The townhome is in a perfect location - it's on a quiet street but only 2or 3 blocks from Barton Springs Drive with food, groceries, etc. We were 1.5 miles from the convention center, which made it super easy to get there and back multiple times per day.

The back deck is great for hanging out and having breakfast. The bedroom is really big, and the biggest plus of all was that the bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. Enough so that I checked what kind of mattress it was before we left!

The coffee and the french press were so welcome the morning after we arrived. We got into town at 1:00 a.m. and didn't have enough time to stop to get any groceries, but to have fresh ground coffee the next day was such a treat!

The space itself was very clean and comfortable with a ton of natural light which we loved. It’s located on a hill and so it’s back deck is in the trees which adds not only a nice view but also a little seclusion. We’ll miss having breakfast on that deck. Other than the great space, the owners (Peach, Cynthia and Jay)were super nice and laid back and very helpful with our questions about what to do in the area. Jay had a ton of suggestions for great places to eat that were amazing and that we wouldn't have otherwise found. All in all, we had a great time and can’t wait to come visit again. I've already recommended this place to many of my friends thinking about going to Austin. Thank you Peach, Cynthia, and Jay for such a great time.

It was a last minute invitation, so hotel rooms were scarce. I found this little gem of a place on VRBO. It turned out that we spent a lot more time there than anticipated, as the tournament was a total rain out. It was so much nicer hanging out in this great little condo than a hotel! Fully stocked house, owners were super helpful and friendly. The king bed was extremely comfortable, and so was the queen sofa bed (which was a nice surprise!). The only reason I did not give a 5 star review was the parking situation. This place is in a very hilly area of Austin, and the parking spot was on a steep incline. OK if you have an SUV, but for a car like mine, that has a low front bumper, it was very dicey. And when the pavement was wet (which was the whole time I was there), I skidded getting in and out of the parking spot. I actually had to use low gear, and certainly parking brakes are a must. Otherwise the stay was great, and the price was right on. The parking issue will certainly not stop me from renting here again. Definitely would recommend!

The place itself is perfect for an individual or family. It has one bedroom, and a foldout couch in the lovely living room, and a great porch to hang out on. The owners care about the people that stay and it shows in the detailed care they've taken of the place and the work they do to make sure he guests have everything they need. They provided great lists of activities, had up to date local newspapers and magazines with recommendations and were always willing to help should I need anything.

Nearby the house is pretty much everything ""sweet"" about Austin. You have the massive Zilker park, with miles of hiking / biking / running trails (and several bike rental places nearby), and you have the amazing neighborhoods south of downtown and also downtown moments away from the front door.

With them you have the benefits of a professional business (great customer service, attention to detail, streamlined processes, etc) AND the benefits of cozy, personalized rental space.

The Sweet is appropriately named; it is truly a charming space with just the right amount of leg room. My husband and I stayed for a few days with our daughter (8 month old) and our dog. There was plenty of room in the bedroom for us to keep the pack n play and room enough in the closet and dresser to unpack and stay a while. We ended up all three sleeping in the ridiculously comfortable king size bed and it was so relaxing!

The main living area looks just like it does in the photos. It's not huge, but for spending a weekend away for an anniversary it was perfect! We moved the easy chair and put our dog kennel there and the owners even provided a high chair for us to have in the dining area (so thoughtful of them to ask)!

We didn't have to buy any supplies like toilet paper, trash bags, etc. (we've stayed in places that had you do it yourself) and we were SO close to every option for food and groceries.

The property was very clean and well-maintained inside and out. The parking is kind of different for The Sweet because it's at the bottom of a hill, but the owner was very sweet about letting us park in a different spot so that our SUV would fit comfortably.

I would absolutely recommend Zilker Vacations overall and The Sweet if you are a smaller family or even just one person. They are close to EVERYTHING and they are wonderfully accommodating hosts!

We never enjoyed sleeping better in all of our vacations than we did here, and usually I end up with an allergy after the first night in the hotels, but not in this one – the beds were so comfortable, with really clean sheets.

As we started planning the trip we found hotel prices to be ridiculous so decided to explore condo optioins. We were lucky enough to find The Sweet! From the very beginning Jay and Cynthia were fantastic - booking our reservation was easy and they kept in contact with us right up until our stay, sending us updates on F1 news and events. When we arrived the porch light was on and we felt welcomed right from the start.

The bedroom was a perfect size for 2 adults and our 4 year old slept comfortably on the pull out couch. The bed in our bedroom was SO comfortable that I asked what mattress they use. We need to get one like that. The Reynolds also provided a pack n' play for our 1 year old to sleep in. It fit perfectly in the living room next to the couch so we could keep the children together and have our privacy.

The kitchen was totally stocked with everything we needed for cooking. However, I think the can opener was broken so make sure it has been replaced before you get canned foods. We also used the grill on the patio to cook out on which was perfect for lunches and dinners. Whole Foods was only a couple of miles from the condo which we loved.

Our boys really enjoyed going to Barton Springs pool and also taking the train ride at Zilker Park. Be advised the pool is closed for cleaning on Thursdays so plan ahead. Also you cannot take coolers or food into the pool area. Don't go at lunch time when you are hungry.

This condo is a great location is you want to be near restaurants and Zilker Park. There are numerous restaurants just down the street. We loved the burgers at P'Terrys if you want a quick pick up lunch.

Only downside to this condo was the parking area. The condo is on the backside of the building in which there is a steep slope. You must be careful when walking up or down the hill to get to your car.

There is a washing machine and dryer just around the corner from the condo which was really convenient for us. We were able to do our laundry for free and come home with clean clothes. You only need to get your own detergent.

We highly recommend this rental for others to stay and will definitely be back to visit this place again in the future.

We especially appreciated the fact that so many basic pantry items were left for our use. The decorating was cute, too. We had a good time renting bicycles and riding over to Ladybird Lake and Deep Eddy.

Everything was clean and in good working order, with plenty of drawer and closet space.

The biggest problem we had was with parking. We were afraid that we were going to damage our car or miss seeing someone behind us as we backed out of the steep parking space. Also, the steps going down to our unit could use some attention. The last couple of steps are long and uneven.

Overall, we had a great stay!

The suite has one large bedroom and a nice living room area. It was a little cozy with 4 people but we were all comfortable. You do have to walk through the bedroom to access the bathroom. The pictures are very accurate, and the condo was clean and well-stocked for our stay.

The Zilker Park trails and attractions are a 5-minute walk from the condo. The weather was gorgeous during our stay and it was very easy to go for a hike or jog. We didn't have a car, but still found it pretty easy to get around. The condo is a short walk (less than a mile) from Restaurant Row on Barton Springs Rd. From there, you can take a bus to the Sixth Street, UT, and South Congress areas. We also had no issues ordering taxis.

The entrance to the condo is at the bottom of a steep driveway, so this rental may not be the best fit for people with disabilities.

The owners were very helpful and responsive.

With sweeping views of downtown Austin from the huge back porch, and stores, bars and eateries just an easy walk from the front door, the location of the house cannot be matched. The house was clean(not spotless),comfortable and well maintained, and it is obvious that much thought has been given to guests’ comfort. The air-conditioning works fantastically well, there is no shortage of hot water, and there is an ample supply of eclectic books to read. There is also a nice supply of extra sheets, blankets,towels and cleaning supplies, along with a washer and dryer. The living room features a large screen tv, with ready access to Netflix, Amazon and HBO, and has an extraordinarily comfortable sofa and great chairs. The bathroom, though old, contains everything needed for comfort- including individual shampoos, conditioners and soap bars (and that ever-present hot water). Despite the lack of a table, the kitchen is large, and has the usual appliances, including a great coffee maker, but lacks a dishwasher (not a problem if you bring the two-handed kind). Other than the front door, there are only two other doors in the interior- one for the bathroom, and one separating the two connecting bedrooms. Curtains provide some degree of privacy to the front of each bedroom, but not much. This only proved to be a problem during early morning hours, when whispering instead of talking allowed for sleeping guests to continue to slumber. Although we didn't need to contact them, we received periodic texts from Turnkey checking on our comfort, and they seemed to be at the ready to help. The only complaint we had with the property is that there were roaches (and palmetto bugs are roaches). During the last two days of our stay, we saw 7 large ones, all inside the house. Although the roaches may be found all over Texas, they can, and should be controlled in a guest house. But for these uninvited guests, I would give ChillVille a five star rating- the roaches brings it down to fou

We loved our stay, it is the perfect location, walking distance to great parks and the river, a lot of awesome restaurants, and maximum 10 minute drive to get to all the best Austin has to offer. The place was comfy and has all the amenities needed while the backyard is a great bonus. The one minor complaint would be the run-ins with cockroaches (6 times), but may just be part of Texas living, and I do not mind some bugs, but did spook our 2 year old a bit.

Hi- The location was amazing, but the stay was not. We had two people knock on our door at night, one being a homeless man which was very uncomfortable having a small baby. Nooks and crannies of the house were not clean- cleaning is wiping down all surfaces, even insides of closets etc. There were also large cockroaches, we found 3 overall in the home, which was again concerning with a small child. Bed linens were old, there was not even dish soap for dishes. Overall was a bit disappointed. We left the dish soap, tea and some other items for your future guests.

It is an older house that has been judiciously upgraded. It is very cute and has room to spread out. There are 3 beds; the daybed in the entry was not very firm and it is a standard twin size; so consider carefully if an adult plans to sleep there.

Food trucks - and restaurants - are right around the corner, and it is less than a 10 minute drive to the UT campus. It is near a major park, bike rentals, and the Colorado river.

This is an adorable older home that is about a mile to South Congress, Alamo Drafthouse, or the bats at Congress St Bridge. There are a few bars and restaurants just a couple blocks away. Everything else is just a short $5 uber ride away. The location and price can't be best for that proximity! It is nestled at the edge of a residential area but the city skyline is viewed just off the back deck. The back yard lis a fantastic plus for a home so close to the heart of it all! All the amenities you would need are in the home. And the professional management company makes the whole process very east and smooth. Even eliminating the need to meet to get a key (there's just a code at the door). Highly recommend!

Great place. I was there for a conference and stayed downtown for the week and then at this place for an extended weekend... This was much better than the hotel. There's good food in walking distance. Thoms Market is close and a great place to get some coffee, snacks, and a few supplies. Downtown is walkable too depending on how much you like to walk. We walked to Barton springs, south congress, and rainy street, a bit of a hike to all but doable. If you can make it to Elizabeth's and get some Vietnamese French fusion do it!

You won't regret a stay in Chill Ville! This property has everything you'll need for a comfortable stay, and the location couldn't be more convenient -- within walking distance to downtown and the Palmer Events Center (the purchase of our trip was to attend a conference here, and it was less than a 3-minute walk there!). We enjoyed sitting out on the back deck in the evenings. There were several restaurants within a 5 minute walk and an abundance of options downtown within a 12-15 minute walk. I would highly recommend Austin Java as a great breakfast spot.

The only ding on this property is the lack of a dining table inside the home (there is one on the patio), but I can understand why, as space is somewhat limited. We really enjoyed our second visit, and could not have been happier with the improvements. We even had to approach the next door neighbor for jumper cables one morning, and they were very friendly and helpful. Bonus!

If you are visiting Austin and want a quiet location near the Long Center, downtown and the river, this rental is perfect. Easy access to the park & event center, walking distances to great restaurants, and quick access to Zilker Park and Mopac & I-35 make it incredibly convenient.

If you are a fan of open floorplans and night-time views of downtown, I recommend the Chillville rental. We have started to think of it as a second home when we visit (from Houston). We would definitely rent again.

1851,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p334861#reviews,"Oct 26, 2014",4/5,Great location for downtown Austin events & activities,"We really loved the location of this home. It was convenient to the Long Center, the river parks and a great selection of restaurants. It also offered quick access to Mopac and locations in SW Austin, where we spent a lot of time.

Things we liked:

1. great size for the two of us (only 1 restroom)

2. kitchen was well stocked

3. great back yard & deck with seating & grill

4. quaint street with beautiful trees (very relaxing)

5. easy walk to restaurants, park & Long Center

6. access to laundry room

7. parking off the street (driveway, not garage)

8. great breezes pulled through the house each evening

What we didn't like:

1. house was not clean (heavy dust under furniture, food & debris on floors

2. mold growing on the shower tile & bottom of shower curtain

3. water leak in laundry room causing wet carpet & mold on the back wall

4. banging starting at 4:30am due to BBQ restaurant at the back fence

5. no dining table; only barstools at the kitchen island

6. the key code access made it easy to get in without keys

Would we stay here again? Yes, especially if the cleaning issues were eliminated and the water leak in the laundry room was fixed. The location and easy access to Austin far outweighs the other issues. The neighborhood is lovely. The house was a good size for the two of us (one bathroom would be challenging with more than 2 people). The back deck, good size yard and views of downtown Austin at night were magical. Pack your earplugs and some Clorox wipes, and you're good. The driveway will fit two cars, but if needed there were also parking permits for street parking in front of the house. If you like to bike, bring them as we saw many locals on bikes and there is great access to parks, paths and activities/restaurants in the area. It's also a great area to walk.

This house would be perfect for a young mobile couple with up to two children. I'd also recommend it to friends traveling together as long as they're close, as only one bedroom actually closes off. All other sleeping spaces are divided by curtains on wires. You'll need to be flexible about privacy. Anything more than that, and you'll be fighting over the bathroom. It's a small house, but again - the location and neighborhood is ideal.

"
1852,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p334861#reviews,"Oct 25, 2014",4/5,A+ Location for Downtown Austin Area,"We loved the location of this house and the charming neighborhood it was in - great trees, tons of squirrels, a mix of old & new construction, and for the most part, quiet. The size of the house was perfect for the two of us. The only real doors in the house are the front door, sliding glass door to the back yard, and the bathroom door. The rest of the house, bedrooms included, are divided with curtains strung on wires. It was a little odd at first, but we opened everything up and left it that way for the week. The nighttime views of the downtown lights were really great, as was the easy walk to restaurants on Barton Springs Rd and the park adjacent to the Long Center. Beds & seating were comfortable, the kitchen was small but had the appliances we needed, and there was an ample supply of paper goods, toiletries, and kitchen supplies & seasonings as well as pots/pans/dishes.

Here are the things that made it a 4-star instead of 5-star rating:

1. the house was not well cleaned; debris on the floors, mold on the shower tile, thick dust under the daybeds and furniture, and half-eaten food in the fridge left by resident or previous renters.

2. no dining table; the only seating for meals is a kitchen island with stools.

3. leak in the laundry room causing soggy carpet & mold behind the washer.

4. the back patio & seating with views was great; the mosquitoes were not (which is a reflection on south Texas, not the house).

5. There is a BBQ restaurant bordering the back fence. Early morning banging (either dumpster pick-up or wood being thrown into the smokers?) was loud and disruptive to sleep, as it usually happened between 4:30-6am daily.

6. One bathroom is an issue if more than 2 people stay or if you have guests.

That said, we would stay here again if the cleaning situation was remedied. I'd also recommend ear plugs for those early morning restaurant noises and occasional sirens off Barton Springs. If you like to bike, bring it with you. There are plenty of places close by you could easily ride to, as we saw lots of neighbors on bikes. The off-street parking (driveway, not garage) was nice and enough to accommodate two cars. Additional hang-tags for guest parking on the street were also provided, if you expect guests. The pass code entry made it a breeze to come in & out without fumbling for keys. The house is old but well cared for and we enjoyed the wood floors, great light from windows and the peaceful setting of Daniel Street.

I came across this property within about 3 days from check in date and immediately emailed Jay (property manager) who emailed quickly and gave me the info on this house. The house is exactly as pictured and described. The location is perfect! It is one block away from Barton Springs road and Palmer Events Center. Lots of within walking distance restaurants and shops. Best thing: it is about 1/2 mile from Downtown. Beautiful parks within walking distance to enjoy with your pooch. The kitchen was fully equiped. The bed in the master bedroom was very comfy. I cannot testify as to the two twin beds since we did not use them. The house has a gas bbq but we did not use. The patio is fantastic and has views of downtown. The a/c worked great even with 103 degrees outside. The house is great for a couple, and even if it sleeps up to 4-6, it lacks a little privacy for the people staying in the twin bedroom (area) because it has a curtain rather than a door. So the house is great for either a couple or a girls' trip or a family that does not require full privacy.

The living room area is open and filled with windows to enjoy the beautiful patio and views of Austin Downtown. We had issues with the tv signal and Jay quickly sent two different people to fix the problem and it was solved within hours. Overall, I will definetely consider staying here again for my next Austin getaway. Thanks Jay for everything! You are truly a gem! and so is this property!

The backyard was incredible and the property manager, Cindy, was super accommodating. We didn't need to, but she several times let us know she's available 24/7! Big open spaces and enough room to hang out before hitting the night scene. Ubers to downtown were super affordable. I would recommend this location for sure!

The only suggestion I would give would to be more communicative with the security deposit. I had to reach out after a week for follow up, which I did then receive the full deposit. It's probably just a timing issue, but if that's the case an e-mail indicating that the deposit would be returned based on management's review would be a nice add to an already great experience.

We spent the weekend in ATX for my bachelorette party, & this house was a rave to all. There were 8 of us total, but the house can easily accommodate 13. Upon arrival Cindy showed us around & was very welcoming. There was so much space for everyone to get ready, & each bathroom was stocked with the necessities that you never remember to pack. The master bathroom had two shower heads & lots of good lighting - both natural lighting & fluorescent. Honor's sons Curran & Cole just happened to be staying the weekend at the other house on the property with their adorable dogs - they were so kind, welcoming, and laid back...just like Austin, Texas. With all of the windows you might think it could get hot with the summer heat, but the AC kept us comfortable all weekend long. There are big trees back behind the house, & curtains for privacy, so that was a plus. All in all I would give this place ten stars if I could. Save yourself the time & book here, because you won't regret your stay.

The house is only a 15 minute drive to downtown, but we still found some good restaurants close to home (Fonda San Miguel is a MUST for delicious Mexican food and beautiful interior). Activities nearby that our group would definitely recommend include: a boat cruise on the river, a visit to the Hope Outdoor Gallery with a stop at the Whole Foods Flagship before or after, and walking down South Congress with a quick detour over to the South Austin trailer park for lunch (Torchy's Tacos!). I cannot say enough good things about this home and will be looking for an excuse to go back to Austin with a group so I can stay here again.

There was significant construction going on right next door while we were here which was a bit distracting in the morning, but this should go away when they're done building the complex. The space is also really open, which is cool, but may be a consideration for those who prefer privacy and/or quiet.

All in all, we highly recommend this house and would stay here again!

Very comfortable beds, great TVs and excellent sound systems for music (we listened to music the entire time we were there). We cooked two meals without any issues (all necessary appliances provided). We easily cabbed it to downtown. We also made use of the fire pit for a gentlemanly cigar session. Our only concern was the lack of standard TV access (Roku system is provided), which kept us from watching the NCAA basketball tournament. Otherwise, I would give this place 5 stars without hesitating. I should note that the owner/facilitators were extrememly accomodating throughout the process, including flexible arrival/departure times and a personal tour upon check-in. Great place, I would definitly stay there again!

The house exceeded my and the groups expectations as it was very spacious and had a very cool design. To echo a previous review, the pictures do not do the house justice. The gated parking area and backyard provided an excellent place to hang out, grill, and enjoy the great weather. We enjoyed a great Saturday full of football and utilized the multiple flat screen T.V.s and seating areas. The house is conveniently located within walking distance of a bowling alley, which was a great warm up to a short cab ride down to 6th street. I would recommend this house for a small or large group who is looking for a great time in Austin.

The entire place is gorgeous. Fully gated, very large parking area with a grill, grass, and seating area. The actually house itself was much bigger than I thought, even from the pictures. 2 flat screen tvs for watching football. The house is very close to the bus line, or a very quick cab to the bars on 6th. Great BBQ a few blocks away.

The manager was great as well. Very easy to set up a reservation. He even allowed us to check out late, which was awesome considering we had a bunch of people taking flights at different times. All in all, the manager was extremely accommodating to our situation.

Beautiful property, outstanding owners and wonderful wedding week!","The Palms is a gorgeous property that provided an ideal escape for my family during a busy wedding week. My son got married at a location overlooking Lake Travis. Our home is 6 hours away and my daughter was doing all the flowers for the wedding so we needed a place to spread out to process flowers and make all the arrangements and bouquets. The Lakefront Suite provided a beautiful large kitchen and exceptional outdoor area, with beautiful, soothing water features, that allowed us to get everything delivered and prepared. Once my parents arrived, my husband and I moved to the Garden House which accommodated my brother and sister-in-law as well and let Mom and Dad (who are in their 80's) stay in the Lakefront Suite. It has a beautiful king room and less steps for them to manage. Having the separate house allowed us privacy and the ability to keep irregular hours without disturbing my parents. The property was gated and secure. My Mom said she felt she was at a European Villa, as we enjoyed coffee on the lovely patio. The suite provided us a large living area where we played cards, played pool, and ate several nice meals. The kitchens in both properties contained more than the basic needs and the makings for breakfast were provided. It felt like walking into someone's beautiful home and living there for a few days. The rehearsal dinner was at The Oasis, which is very convenient to the house and allowed us to take Mom and Dad home when they were tired and we were able to stay longer with our guests. The wedding venue was around the bend and only took about 8 minutes to get there. The difference between the venue and The Palms was immense and I was so happy I booked the property. We looked forward to getting back to The Palms to enjoy our private little paradise. The owners, Rodney and Robin live on the property, but we never felt like we were sharing their space. Robin was great about staying in touch with me to ensure we had all we needed and if there was anything more she could do. I am confident, had I needed anything, she would have done all she could do to make it happen. The Saturday morning of the wedding, all the groomsmen came over and enjoyed the dock, the basketball court, the pool table, the patio area and the overall experience. A favorite memory for me will be the time spent entertaining all the boys as well as the quality family time spent at The Palms. We would love to return someday as the overall experience was excellent!

We floated in the quiet cove with the floats they provided, and did some quiet time fishing. We all loved the dipping pool/hot tub, pool table and the surround sound music was perfect.

We were a family group, 7 adults and a baby and we stayed 5 nights. We reserved both areas - the Lake View Suite and the Garden House. The living areas were as comfortable as depicted (and spic & span clean! ) and the outdoor areas were as lovely as shown in the pictures. Be sure to try out the lawn swing in the early evening and watch for fireflies - utterly peaceful!

Robin and Rodney were responsive hosts and were always available anytime we had questions.

Our favorite areas were the large covered stone patio and the spa/splash pool. We grilled most evenings and enjoyed sitting outside, soaking in the spa, and visiting.

The kitchens were well equipped as well as stocked with the makings for our first breakfast - a real plus!

The attention to all the big and little details that make a home away from home enjoyable and comfortable were amply provided.

There were 10 of us; 6 in the Garden House and 4 in the Lake Front House. Robin met us upon arrival and showed us around both houses. She and Rodney both were very friendly and accommodating. One day we had scheduled a boating trip and they were so kind as to give us a ride to the boat marina. They also gave us a lot of privacy, even though they live on the property, we very seldom saw them. The property description and photos are very accurate, the place is absolutely gorgeous. I especially enjoyed all the beautiful lights around the property at night, very pretty. Both houses are stocked with all the listed amenities. There was plenty of bath and beach towels. The A/C worked great and plenty of hot water and good water pressure. I would highly recommend this place for families and friends. We had a wonderful time!

Due to unfortunate timing I arrived with my foot in a cast, getting around with my knee on a little scooter. By noon the next day Robin and Rodney had put a ramp in place to help me get up the steps, entirely on their own initiative. The landscaping and the grounds are beautiful with plenty of places to enjoy the view. Sitting on the terrace with a cup of coffee enjoying the view of the lake was the best part of the morning. Everything we needed was provided. This is a great place to spend some quality time with your family.

The grounds are perfect, from the huge hottub to the hammock to the patio with heaters to fireplace - everything need to have a great vacation. My family had a wonderful time, want to move in and never leave. My kids chose an extra night at The Palms over a night in Sea World - if that doesn't say it all..... As great as the website is, the actual property is better and Robin could not be a more perfect host.

There was plenty of space for everyone to have privacy and also gather for meals and fun.

The property is stunning with amazing views of the lake. The outdoor common area is lovely with very comfortable loungers and umbrellas for shade. The property is clean and there is an abundance of “supplies” (kitchen, bath, “noodles” for the lake, etc.). There was more to do (games, fishing, bocce ball) than we had time for in our long weekend!

The owners were extremely responsive both leading up to and during our trip. They provided detailed information so that we knew exactly what to expect and to allow for our vacation to begin the moment we arrived. In fact, they greeted us on arrival and provided tips on local restaurants and music.

She is very responsive and helpful on any and all requests and questions we had.

The second bedroom was very handy. My parents were able to visit for part of the time, and with plenty of privacy. Also, I used the desk in this room to work during weekdays, without worrying about noise/commotion from others.

We brought our dog along. That also worked out very well. There are plenty of dogs in the condo complex and it is very well setup for dogs. Walking him was easy, either in the adjacent neighborhood or Austin's hike and bike trail (great place for dogs).

We love Austin. This wasn't our first time to Austin, but it was the first time we rented a place. We really couldn't have picked a better experience with Susie, her place, and the location. We would definitely pay a return visit.

This bungalow was perfect! It's clean and uncluttered, which gives it a very spacious feel, but is also a welcoming and quiet place to relax after a long day of running around. There are also lots of parks and playgrounds within walking distance, making it very family-friendly. Easy walk to a few good cafes, restaurants, and grocery stores too.

I appreciate his timely and not overbearing communications. He provides very descriptive instructions and information including an inventory of items in each room, which takes guessing out of the stay (if you're concerned about that type of thing). About us: a professional couple without the kids for a week. We needed wireless (provided and dependable), a kitchen (well appointed with a gas stove but no dishwasher), and plenty of office space (we're both on the phone constantly). There is one bathroom, one bedroom, a living room with couch, and a small office area - bringing our three kids (14, 11, and 7 years old)would not be an option. We joked that we would rent the adjoining home to put them in next time.

The net is, if you want to experience residential living in an austin community with walkable restaurants (Mother's/ Hyde Park Bar & Grill), neighbors with urban chickens & chicken coops, and a 10-15 min drive to Zilker Park, with friends or your partner, this is the place for you. You may want to look elsewhere if you have multiple kids or are with another couple.

The place is centrally located and close to many restaurants and other amenities. We had a wonderful dinner at Vino Vino which is practically around the corner from the rental. They had great food and a large selection of tasty wines. We were also close to Zilker Park, where we kayaked on Lady Bird Lake which is within the park, I would highly recommend doing the same.

I am so glad I found this property! The house was immaculately clean and fresh. We only stayed for 2 nights, but were very happy with the extra room and privacy this afforded us compared to a hotel room. There's even a cat sanctuary across the road, so I didn't have to go very long without my own fur-babies!

The place was spotless and located so well for our needs that my husband was able to jog by both of our kids' apartments every day. The neighborhood is lovely and safe. I even went for a few late night walks and felt completely comfortable.

We stayed for 7 nights and hope to stay longer next time. Pete is a peach, quick to respond and always available, although we never needed anything. The rental and deposit return all went as smooth as silk. We highly recommend this location and Pete for a peaceful and comfortable stay in Austin's beautiful Hyde Park area.

2028,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p346235#reviews,"Feb 1, 2015",5/5,Great bungalow home in incredible neighborhood,"My young daughter and I stayed at this rental for two months this past summer and we could not have asked for more generous vacation accommodations. While the space is set up in a ""railroad"" fashion with one room following the other, it offered ample privacy and spacious room for additional guests. The furnishings were well kept and the kitchen had nearly all necessities to cook a proper meal and/or entertain others. The bathroom was a good size and offered even more closet space than was already provided in the bedroom. With both closets and a dresser in the main bedroom, I had ample space to store clothing, accessories and travel boxes for myself and my family. At the same time, this rental offers great light during the day and even with the summer heat of Texas, the air conditioning worked fabulously and kept the unit cool at all times. Pete lives just around the corner and was on hand to offer suggestions for local eateries, childcare and anything else that might have come up.

If you are not familiar with austin, the neighborhood itself is one of the best in town. Not only is it safe, but its fantastic location puts you close to the action of downtown, without having to deal with the parking and traffic issues at every moment. Ut austin is only blocks away and my daughter and I frequently drove the 3-5 miles to some of the activities directly downtown. At the same time, there are several restaurants and two public pools located just blocks away. Even in the summer, we looked forward to our walks to Quacks, the local bakery and the Hyde Park Grill- we highly recommend both! We also brought our bike and spent several Sundays checking out the trails.

This really is a great space and we look forward to our next stay in the near future. You can't beat its location and accommodations. Staying here truly helped to give us a sense of austin's fabulous culture.

Lots of natural light, fun & quirky Austin vibe (go through bedroom to get to kitchen, through kitchen to get to bathroom), spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The kitchen was sufficiently equipped for us to cook breakfast every morning, enjoy a glass of wine and a few nibbles in the evening. We could have cooked dinner, too, but chose to enjoy the wonderful restaurants around town (VinoVino, Asti, Mother's Cafe & many others are a short walk away). Pete was very responsive & helpful. The keyless entry system worked like a charm. I would highly recommend this place for a couple, though 3 could stay if they get on well (bathroom is off the office/porch w/ the second bed/daybed).

Pete was the consummate host - responding to our every email, taking care of small items that we addressed. The reservation process was fast and very efficient, with no problems. The security deposit was refunded the same day we left.

The unit is sparkingly clean, a big kitchen and small office with a back yard to enjoy in better weather. It is a 1915 or so house so don't expect triple track windows and ultra modern conveniences. Plenty of closet space and attractively decorated. The front door has no key but a pass code - less keys to keep track of. Laundry is on the premises.

We stayed at the end of restaurant week and enjoyed many fine restaurants here in Austin! Swift's Attic on Congress in downtown was one of our favorites.

Clean, updated rentals with great internet, access to laundry and all in one of our favorite neighborhoods. Pete's professionalism has been great and he's been available whenever we've had questions or booked on short notice.

The location is great. Restaurants, coffee shops/bakeries and a grocery all within walking distance. Bus and bike routes run through Hyde Park so access to UT and downtown are easy. Depending on time of day, it's 10-20 minutes drive time into downtown via city streets. If you are a Car2Go member, lots of neighbors use the service so cars are usually close by.

This bungalow apartment retains it's historic charm while having been updated. The layout is dog run style as mentioned in one of the other reviews with the main bedroom between the living room and the kitchen. The bathroom is accessed just off the kitchen in the sun room area. (Wouldn't be a problem other than slight privacy issues if you had the max number of guests in the house.)

Two 71-year-olds in austin on their inaugural visit to their first grandchild. The bungalow could not have provided a more ideal home for us during that joyous occasion. The extremely well maintained apartment was spotless on arrival, equipped with everything one could need, and comfortable in all respects. The location is ideal: excellent restaurants, bakeries, groceries and a wine bar are in fact within walking distance. And what delightful walks they are within a lovely residential neighborhood. On top of it all, it is good to know that Pete always is available should there be a need. We plan to return to austin 3-4 times a year now and our first step for each trip will be to check on the availability of the bungalow.

As other reviewers have said, the property is in a nice well-established neighborhood of lovely homes. Although I felt completely safe in the neighborhood, it was nice to know that there were also others in the two additional units in the building, and the keypad entry provided extra security. The property was immaculately clean and very well maintained! Everything looked freshly painted. One thing that I have not seen mentioned was that the bed was most comfortable. I was a little concerned about that, as I had not seen it mentioned in any of the reviews, but as soon as I arrived in town, I laid down for just a moment to rest, and quickly sunk into a deep sleep., thanks to the comfy bed. The owner Pete was absolutely wonderful, as others have mentioned. He was immediately responsive to any concern, and I know it sounds like a cliché, but he really did everything possible to make my stay go smoothly. My only concern is that it might become so popular that I won’t be able to rent it the next time I come to town! Thanks Pete!

There is a Fiesta right down the road if you feel like saving money and cooking in the well equipped kitchen. If not, SoCo is only a 15 minute drive. I really suggest trying HopDoddy's FANTASTIC burgers (you will stand in a line forever but it's worth the wait).

It's located in a gorgeous neighborhood and you can get to all the downtown hotspots in 10 mins or so. The Hyde Park area is pretty hip-and-happening anyway. You can walk a few blocks and hit up a fabulous bakery, Quack (the carrot cake- OMG), or grap a margarita or a huge plate of breakfast at Julio's for cheap (cash only)! Also, heard the italian restuarant by the grocery store is really good but didn't have the opportunity to try it out. However, if you're there on a Monday or Tuesday, you must try the fried chicken at the Hyde Park Grill (right next door to Julio's)! It's a wonderful area so rather live like an Austinite, stay here and do not waste your money on a hotel by Town Lake. Austin is a really fun town and there's so much to do, whether you have kids or not. It's a very kid-friendly town. LOVED the claw-foot tub and also having the option of the pull-out sofa.

Our unit was fresh, clean, well-appointed, with everything we needed to make our stay easy and hassle-free. In particular, Pete (the owner), was attentive, concerned that we feel well taken care of, and immediately responsive if we needed anything. We were within walking distance of our family and grandchildren and, of course, of the many Hyde Park amenities. The bakery/coffee shop, Quacks, was a favorite, as well as Mother's, Hyde Park Grill, and Daily Juice.

- Stayed with our 10 month old and 3 year old and the lay-out was perfect - our unit had 4 rooms consecutively linked (family/TV room, bedroom, kitchen, spare bedroom/office). Bathroom was linked off of the office - happily our 10 month old slept there and he's a solid sleeper so getting to the bathroom after he went to sleep wasn't an issue.

- A/C worked great, no annoying noise complaints.

- Quiet and safe neighborhood with super cute homes and yummy restaurants within short walking distance.

- Pete (the owner) was fantastic too! Super responsive and available for questions, etc.

2062,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p346235#reviews,"Oct 9, 2011",4/5,Great vacation rental,"My husband and I stayed here over Austin City Limits weekend and it was perfect for our needs! The place was very clean and simple and was exactly what we were looking for. Our unit had plenty of space for 2. We enjoyed all of the amenities and used them oftern (laundry, internet, DVD, air conditioning, cable, etc.) It's in a quaint family neighborhood but still very close to DT and other interesting neighborhoods. Overall this place is a great value and beats the costs of staying in any hotel. Pete is also very responsive and easy to work with and I would highly reccommend renting from him in the future.

It was cozy and comfortable, just what we wanted. The house was very clean and well maintained. It was never loud and the neighborhood was very nice. There was even a cute park nearby. Pete was great and very considerate. I would definitely recommend this house to others for a vacation in Austin!

2065,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p346235#reviews,"Aug 8, 2011",5/5,Great Austin Apartment for Small Family,"My husband, 4-year-old son, and I stayed in this wonderful apartment for 3 nights in June. We already knew the neighborhood (Hyde Park: beautiful, walkable, family-friendly neighborhood) and chose the place for its location: you can walk to a variety of restaurants, a bakery, an organic grocer, and the Shipe playground and free pool and wading pool (June-Aug.) It turned out to be even better than we expected: the apartment was airy (huge windows, high ceilings), furnished with great taste, comfortable, and clean. Soundproofing was great (there was a family with two kids staying in another apartment which is part of the same house, and we did not hear them at all. Pete, the owner, is very helpful, friendly, and professional. Our deposit was returned promptly. Note to parents: the bathroom is attached to the second bedroom/sun room, which means you have to walk through the bedroom to go to the bathroom after your kid goes to bed. This could be an issue for parents of light sleepers. It was not a problem for us, but I think it's worth mentioning. I would go back in a heart beat. As a matter of fact, we are already planning our next stay!

2066,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p346235#reviews,"Jul 8, 2011",5/5,Excellent Place!,"This was an excellent choice for my stay at home vacation. My boyfriend and I loved the ambience of the place, the spaciousness, the layout and the taste in decoration. It was everything I needed to be comfortable in Austin. I was impressed by the airiness and high ceilings of the place. There are three units in this bungalow, and I believe all of them have been really well maintained by Pete. I loved the rugs and the modern look of the furniture. Not only that, the keyless entry is wonderful! No need to carry something around just your memory. There's cable and internet and individual AC in each unit. There's also a fan in almost every single room. Score! This house also could sleep many people. Couch, queen size bed, and daybed in the sunroom. My only discrepancy would be the lack of light in the closet and the lack of a full length mirror and the lack of thick curtains to block out light at night, but everything else was perfect! These things wouldn't stop me from renting this place again.

It's also located in such a great area of Austin. Hyde Park is a beautiful neighborhood with home averaging at the $500-$600k price range. Lucky us to stay in a charming neighborhood.

Thanks for such a great place!

"
2071,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p346235#reviews,"Mar 22, 2011",5/5,Great stay in Hyde Park,"I stayed here for 6 nights during SXSW and it turned out to be a great way to avoid the madness of downtown Austin during a big event (while only being a 10 minute car ride / $12 cab ride away).

Although the photos were accurate the rental was much more spacious than I'd expected! It would be more than enough room for up to 4 people. All the appliances were in working order, the decor was simple and tasteful and the bed was comfortable. Plenty of closet and dresser space, as well. I used the glasses, plates, silverware and a few pans - I made one grocery run at the beginning of my stay which saved me $$ in food costs.

The rental was clean and well-maintained. I'm a stickler for clean bathrooms and this one was immaculate. The only drawback in the bathroom was a lack of counter space, but being an older home there's not much you can do about that configuration! I got creative with moving a dining room chair into the bathroom so I could lay out my makeup and toiletries. The heat and a/c both worked very well and I was comfortable during my entire stay.

The location is great! Aside from its ""not too close, not too far"" proximity to downtown Austin, the rental is within a short walk of some great Hyde Park businesses (Quack's Bakery, a grocery store, a gelato place, Mother's Cafe, a spa where I got the best massage I've had in months) and I also went walking and running around the Hancock Golf Course located a few blocks away. The first two nights some people nearby were partying rather loudly (and late). However, it seemed to be the exception rather than the rule as the neighborhood was extremely quiet the rest of my stay. All neighbors I encountered were friendly.

I'd recommend this to anyone who wants a ""local"" Austin experience or as an alternative to staying in a hotel.

The home is well maintained, spacious and comfortable. There seems to be 3 main centers of activity and nightlife in Austin with South Congress being one of them. The home is one block away from shops and bars and restaurants and just a few blocks away from some great food trucks. Chad checked in with us by phone soon after we arrived and made sure we were settled in and let us know how to contact him if we needed to, but because everything was exactly as advertised there was no need to contact him. Overall, the home provided us with everything we needed.

It's perfectly located right off South Congress, and easily accessible to all the best restaurants, cafes, and shops. The house is surprisingly large, with big bedrooms and a great kitchen and back deck. The best part about the house is its only one street behind all the fun, but its completely serene, quiet, and a true Austin neighborhood. The highlight for our family was getting BBQ take out from Franklin's, sitting on the back deck with a beer, and enjoying the great backyard. It was truly a great place to stay and it made our vacation very memorable.

The kitchen island is large and with stools, so all were able to congregate there. The living room couch was large and comfy and provided great space to connect. All linens we needed were provided. The location is really awesome because so many shops and fantastic restaurants are within a block and a half away, but you do not hear any busy-ness/traffic from this home.

This house is literally one block off of South Congress, which seemed like the hot spot to be in Austin. We walked to grab food from several different restaurants during our stay, which was always delicious, and very convenient. Although we did not hit up any of the local bar scene, we seemed to be in the right spot for that had we wanted to.

The owner, Chad, was professional, polite, and helpful throughout the entire process. He met us at the house upon check-in to welcome us, show us around his house, and fill us in on the local area. He even had maps, and lists of his favorite spots printed out for us, which was very thoughtful. Upon leaving, he swung by to see us off.

The property isn't fancy, but was clean, and well maintained. A perfect layout for our group of four adults (one couple), having two queen sized beds, and one king. This was way better than any hotel option we could have come up with. We spent most of our time (while not at ACL) lounging in the large living room, gathered around the kitchen bar eating, or having a morning coffee on the back deck. While there were some of the owners personal items in the house, they were mostly put away, and really no issue for any of us.

Overall, it was a great experience, and we will more than likely be reaching back out to Chad for future festivals or Formula 1 races in the future!

This house was lovely ,so fresh, crisp and spotlessly clean. Much roomier than it appears in the pictures. Very comfortable beds and lots of lounging furniture in the living room. Chad was such a gracious rental host, even providing his cell # in case of emergency. Location could not be more perfect! Vespaio and Enoteca on the corner for a delicious meal. All the fabulous shopping, Maya and Uncommon Objects a very short walk away. Right down the side walk toThe Snack Bar patio for a glass of wine or a cappuccino. Guerros for an interesting jalepeno margarita....what's not to love about being in the heart of SOCO?!

We will definitely rent this house on future trips to Austin.

BUT, I liked the idea of being in the South Congress neighborhood so I took a chance. I was delightfully surprised. First the house is easy to find and adorable. The interior design was beautiful with plenty of room, comfy chairs and large wrap around couch to lounge on. The 3 bedrooms had large beds (queens and king) and were very comfy. The info indicated that the house was small, but it's one of those spaces that you walk in and say, WOW, this place feels so large and spacious. We really enjoyed sitting out on the back covered deck in the morning and evenings and were surprised by the antics of two very adorable raccoon babies.

The location couldn't have been better. We were one block behind the famous SoCo shops and restaurants. We used the house for a long weekend to celebrate my daughters graduation from UT. We had family members drive up/fly in and it was a perfect meeting place. When the young adults got bored of the adult chit chat, they could just walk the block over to SoCo and enjoy the eclectic shops, bakeries, coffee shops and restaurants.

This review might seem rather glowing, but I must admit, it's really a nice surprise to walk into a vacation rental and think to yourself, ya, I could live here, no problem....

As described, the house was clean, comfortable, and in a prime location--literally one block away from all that bustling South Congress has to offer. We had gone back and forth on what neighborhood to stay in and were definitely happy with our decision to stay in South Congress. It's a very charming area with great food, shops, and people-watching.

The house was spotless when we arrived, and there was even a set of towels and a new bar of soap waiting for each of us. The furniture was all nice, new, and comfortable (the master bedroom even has a tempurpedic mattress). The front and back porches were great for sitting out on and relaxing. The owner, Chad, was very friendly and accommodating. He was always very prompt in his responses and was more than happy to answer any questions we had about our stay. We all arrived at different times, and he made himself available to be there when the first person arrived.

It starts with a white picket fence and keeps going...white molding, perfect paint colors throughout, white tiled bathrooms, darling furniture, hard wood floors. There is a huge white kitchen with a huge island. Perfect for gathering and chatting with your group, making dinner, giving toasts! Huge deck and yard! We drank coffee every morning sitting on the patio furniture. Space for 6 easily to get ready, watch TV, be in kitchen or be on deck. Only downfall is I wished I had brought my own pillow ( I am a pillow snob ). We walked to Joe's coffee each morning, we walked the two blocks to Perla's restaurant which was fabulous! Oysters and cocktails on their outdoor patio was fantastic! Pizza by the slice after a night out. SOCO and this home has it all! Quick cab ride to downtown for the bars. Walking to the kayak - great location! OH, AND CHAD was sooo helpful and as darling as his home!!!! I only wished the house I was moving into after our trip was as well done!

The property itself is great and the decor/furniture is very well done. The backyard/pool is private and a great place to spend the day. I would definitely recommend this property to others. It has all the technology you need as well such as stereo, apple TV, multiple flatscreens etc. The owners were very nice and always available.

We stayed 2 nights, and it went by much too quickly. Whether sitting on one of the several balconies or lounging in the large pool or hot tub, or just sprawling out on the couch in front of one of the many huge flat screen TV's, this place has everything for a relaxing weekend. It's even wired for sound out on the deck and has a double-decker dock down on the water.

Location was also fantastic. It's a short 5-10 minute drive to downtown, and there's access to watercraft just a short distance away if you'd rather take a shortcut across the lake.

The owner stopped by while we were there to make sure we had everything we needed, to make sure we had figured out how to operate the satellite tv, surround sound, outdoor sound, and hot tub, and to bring us fresh towels for the pool/hot tub. Very nice gentleman.

Excellent experience. I highly recommend it!

The house is located just off a very busy street and we were kept up all Friday and Saturday night by the sounds of motorcycles, sirens and buses. The rooms are dusty, the furniture is worn and the water pressure on the second floor was pathetic. There's no easy path to the walk along the water.

If you're feeling more adventurous downtown and 6th Street is also just a short cab ride away.

It was the perfect house for us, and Tracey was a wonderful host! Seriously, you could not ask for a better location!

We had a great time and the house is centrally located - close to SoCo, Barton Springs, downtown, UT, and easily accessible from I-35. We stayed here because of its location - We were all going to Willie Nelson's 4th of July picnic at Circuit of the Americas. Its easy access to I-35 gives it a centralized location so that you can plan all of your day trips around town. They've thought of everything you've needed for your stay. And if you've forgotten something, HEB on South Congress is a short drive to grab groceries for your stay. Definitely would stay here again!

I will defiantly book again! I only wish the cool lights on the trees worked and maybe some lighting from the porch to the street and car port. However, just suggestions and would stay regardless.

Most of the girls hadn't been to Texas before and this home is an amazing representation of our beautiful state!! It's in the perfect location too. Very easy to find because it is right off I35 but you don't feel like you're in the middle of the city because of the lake in front of the house and all of the huge beautiful trees that surround the neighborhood. There is a great porch swing, a table and chairs in the front of the house, festive lights in the trees and a back yard with a table and chairs so there was plenty of room for all of us to enjoy the outdoor surroundings. The house is very clean and there was plenty of room for all of us to enjoy each other but also have room to ourselves when we needed it. It is just minutes from downtown so we all took cabs to go downtown to eat and do some shopping and it was only about $5 per cab ride.

I can't say enough great things about the house, the owners and the location. I will absolutely rent it again when I have friends who want to come visit Austin. I live in San Antonio and travel to Austin often and this is the perfect place to stay because of the location, cleanliness, tranquility and kindness of the owners.

It was the perfect landing place as we were new to Austin and seriously considering relocating from California. The location is so convenient, close to I-35, South Congress and downtown, all just minutes away. The street is quiet with a large open field next to the house and Lady Bird Lake across the street. The wrap-around porch with swing and chairs offer a relaxing way to enjoy the day. The living room is inviting for hanging out, watching TV and or listening to great music - there is a wide selection of CD's to choose from. The kitchen is well stocked and so versatile - stools at the counter as well as a beautiful wooden table, we hung out here a lot. The master bedroom offers lots of natural light and the bed is most comfortable. The upstairs is so private from downstairs, with comfy couch, seating area and another TV. The bedrooms are well situated to offer privacy, beds were comfortable and sheets and linens were good quality. The property was well taken care of and clean.

The on-line pictures accurately portray the beauty of this property.

Lisa and Tracey are delightful and so responsive to inquiries and requests.

I highly recommend staying at the house for a week-end or an extended stay. The casual, relaxing, private atmosphere was very nurturing.

2212,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3466249#reviews,"Apr 8, 2014",5/5,Fantastic location and amazing setting!!,"I and a group of friends chose this house mostly because of the great location, but we came to find out that this house had much more to offer than that. The house was very clean and roomy with a large wrap-around porch that was perfect for lounging on in the perfect Austin spring weather. The bathrooms were clean and in good condition. There were 6 beds, 2 of which were king/queen, so it can definitely sleep at least 8 (not counting comfy couches and an air mattress!). The common rooms (both upstairs and downstairs) had plenty of seats to accommodate guests and the flat screen had full cable.

Even with all those great amenities, the location is still what stood out to me. I love dogs and this house is a stone’s throw from a popular dog park. However if dogs aren’t your thing there is a large field that separates the house from the park. We arrived in blue bonnet season and the field was in full bloom; it made for quite the vista when looking out over the front porch with the Colorado River in the background. While there is a house next door and a main thoroughfare behind the house, I felt like the location was a very peaceful spot. Secluded enough from the noise of the street, but within a couple minute walk to 35 and a ten minute walk to Rainey St.

All in all this was a wonderful house, in a central location, in a vibrant, fun city. I’m not sure what more one would want in a rent house.

We enjoyed the South Congress area less than a mile away for shopping, drinks and tacos at the food trailers. We went downtown for food and coffee. The four bedrooms (5 beds) are private, well sized and sound doesn't carry easily between them. The living spaces snf porch are perfect for small gatherings and conversation. You could actually entertain pretty effectively in the kitchen if you wanted to. The property manager was great both prior to and after arrival. We would certainly rent this property again and recommend to small groups or families.

There were 10 friends in our group and we were pleasantly surprised when we arrived at the house. It was spacious and stocked with everything we needed. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The house had a wrap around front porch with plenty of seating and it was enjoyable to sit outside in the evenings. I really liked that we could use the nice kitchen to make coffee in the morning and have some food before setting out for the day.

The owner was very helpful and responsive in answering any questions and providing ideas for activities. She also provided a map of the city and suggested some great local restaurants.

The house is located in the historic Travis Heights neighborhood which felt very safe and was quiet in the evenings. Most nights we walked downtown to the restaurants and the bars on 6th street. The cab ride home was a quick $5 ride. The house is also close to Zilker Park/Barton Springs and it's very easy to get to and from the airport. Would highly recommend this rental if you’re planning a vacation to Austin!!

2216,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3466249#reviews,"May 20, 2013",5/5,Perfect Stay!,"We stayed at this lovely home during the madness of SXSW. This was the perfect place to enjoy Austin's scenic beauty and was still an easy walk to the downtown area.

The home itself: I didn't want to leave! From the spacious rooms to the bright windows, it is a warm and welcoming retreat.

Location: It is right along the riverfront, which makes for beautiful views. In fact, there is an adorable dog park down the street - so I spent many mornings drinking coffee on the charming front porch swing & watching puppies walking to the park. (CUTE!)

Cleanliness: The house was brilliantly clean & inviting. It really felt like ""home"".

Customer Service: A detailed list of ""how to"" was left in the kitchen. From ""turning on the TV"" to locking up, there were no issues left unaddressed.

*BONUS* If you're looking for something fun to do - walk down to South Congress and enjoy shopping & eating in that area. Easy jaunt from Riverside, then a left on Congress & voila! You're there!

-Don't hesitate to choose this home during your stay in ATX. I can't wait to go back! :-)

The house itself is a beauty with a nice big patio and nice spacious rooms. We were all very comfortable and loved how accommodating the hosts were.

The house is right over the river from downtown and is super easy to walk back and forth, catch a bus or ride in style in a pedicab. It's equally as easy to walk down to the San Jose Hotel and that wonderful area on South Congress.

 I would highly recommend it if you're looking to come to town with a big group for a music festival or other festivities.

Good communication, easy checkin, and super convenient that she supplied all the extras like laundry detergent, coffee, shampoo, etc. Those little extras really help make a trip go smooth when you are flying in from out of state with very little space in your luggage! The Casita is exactly as pictured charming decor, clean, and with killer views of the city skyline. We loved sitting on the deck after dark with a glass of wine taking in the lights of the city, truly memorable! We rented bikes during our stay and easily travelled to all the sites and restaurants by bike. The layout of the upstairs/downstairs gave enough privacy and space for our family members meeting up in Austin for the weekend. We would definitely stay here again!

It’s the nicest VRBO we have ever stayed at and we were pleasantly surprised when we arrived. It sits on the back of the property. You can hear birds in the morning which we loved and occasionally a train in the distance. It’s quiet, Cozy, SUPER clean, comfortable and BEAUTIFUL! We Stayed for two nights over a birthday weekend. This was our first trip to Austin for our family of four. There’s a spiral staircase (which our teen girls loved) leading to a large second floor loft with very comfortable futon beds that are more like full/queen size, tv, powder room with toilet and sink and AC/heat. An outdoor deck with a great view of the city sits right off the loft. It was rather cold while we were here so we didn’t sit out there too much. Downstairs we found a fully functional kitchen (measuring cups, blender, coffee pot etc) with lots of amenities already there (coffee, spices, tea, cold condiments etc). Tucked away in a litttle closet is a stacked washer dryer that is FULL size with detergent!!! The master bed is extremely comfortable and the sheets were definitely better than what we have at home! the downstairs bathroom has a walk in shower, floor to ceiling tiles, rain shower head directly above with shampoo conditioner and body soap. The towels were fresh and fluffy and white. Downstairs there is a table with four chairs for meals, a desk, dresser and two lounge chairs. We found maps of the city and brochures for about anything Austin you may be interested in. There is a large closet downstairs with tons of extra blankets, sheets, blow up mattress and ironing board. This place easily can accommodate at least one more person maybe two. There are lots of windows (with blinds) and it is very fresh inside. Susana definitely keeps this updated regularly and clearly gives thought to what you might need while you are here with attention to details like the four waters in the fridge. There’s good energy here, good vibes. There wasn’t one thing we said “oh we should’ve brought such and such”. When we come back we will stay here.

The property basically has 2 floors.

The bottom floor has a large bed, sitting table that seats 4, kitchen and full bath with a nice sized shower (no bathtub.) The bed downstairs is very comfortable with nice linens. There's a TV with cable on the wall that you can watch as you lay in bed. The kitchen has everything you need including a nice sized fridge w/freezer, microwave, stove, oven and dishwasher will all the pots/pans and plates you need to prepare and serve dinner for 4. Plenty of windows for great natural light and the thermostat worked perfectly.

Upstairs is a large room with two futons, another large mounted TV, a half bath and a balcony with a fantastic view of downtown that is perfect to enjoy a morning coffee, or an evening bourbon. The room upstairs also had enough room for the best inflated double sized mattress I've ever used. There were more than enough quality linens/blankets and pillows for everyone.

Also, there was a very new washer/dryer that we used to run a few loads of laundry while we enjoyed our stay. There's a carport to leave your vehicle under and while the owners live in a house a few yards away, we had plenty of privacy for our entire stay.

Susana couldn't have been more accommodating and the location just off Lamar made it very easy to drive or Uber to events downtown, at the campus, and all over Austin. But we didn't need to drive very far because there are a ton of fantastic restaurant options less than 2 miles away.

South Congress is just a few blocks away as are Barton Springs and Zilker Park. (And if you're a cyclist, the Bicycle Sport Shop is just down the hill and across the street.) The apartment is clean and fresh and seems recently built. It has everything you would need for a longer stay than we had, including a washer and dryer. The kitchen is well-equipped and the full bathroom has a spacious shower (half bath upstairs). Strong internet connection, too. I recommend this one.

None of us were familiar with the area but we knew we wanted to be close to the city. After staying here I know we made the right choice. The location was perfect, just across the water from downtown about a 2 minute cab ride away. Even though you're not right in downtown having the view from the deck made you feel like you were in the city. We also enjoyed having 2 levels. It gave nice separation when some of us wanted to relax and catch up on sleep while the others could watch TV upstairs and sit out on the deck. The place was nicely furnished and had nice upgrades on the interior. Next time we come back to Austin we will stay here again for sure. One thing to note Austin banned Uber within the city limits so make sure you're ready to cab it everywhere.

It did not disappoint! Very clean, decorated nicely, and had all the comforts of home. The location is awesome. We walked everywhere - dinner at the many restaurants nearby on Barton Springs, shopping and lunch on Congress Avenue, and taking walks on the paths along the water in the nearby Zilker Park. The upstairs balcony has the best view, and we enjoyed our relaxing nights out there!

We even had our own carport! We also enjoyed the million dollar view of the Austin sky line from the balcony. A five minute car ride got us to the heart of Austin to explore the bistros and bars. Five minutes the other direction got us to South Congress. We did not need to bother the owner Susana about anything, but if we did, she was on location. We did have the opportunity to meet and chat with this very lovely woman! Would definitely recommend this place and would also stay here again.

We rented bikes and did the river bike trail. Wanted to swim Barton Springs but closed onThursdays for cleaning. Also $8 entrance fee unless you get there before or after hours, then swim for free. Favorite eating places close by are Shady Grove and Uncle Billys. Guero's on South Congress was lots of fun, they have live music radio broadcast in the Oak Garden on Wednesdays. All the cowboy boots you could want at Allen's and neat gift shops also on SoCo. Favorite Mexican food at Polvos on 1st Street. Across the river, loved J Blacks food, Whole Foods Market a must, and found an awesome little bar/cafe called Mean Eyed Cat- a tribute to Johnny cash, full of memorabilia, good drinks and food.

Everything was so seamless from being able to park our rental car right in the driveway to being able to access the place easily with the code provided by the owner and not having to deal with picking up and dropping off keys. The unit was BEAUTIFUL and the owner welcomed us with a small generous gift which was such a nice touch. The pictures are exactly what the unit looks like which is always a plus. The one picture that is not shown was the rain fall shower which was such a nice touch. Being able to enjoy our morning coffee on our private deck was something that no hotel can offer you. The location is perfect. You are in the heart of South Austin and only a five minute drive from downtown. The only thing feedback I would give the owner is the coffee maker needs to be replaced. The drip does not work properly and created steam so the coffee maker does not brew a proper pot. Therefore we had to boil water and pour it over the coffee grounds. Other than that I can't say enough good things this place. We will definitely be staying here the next time we are in town.

We booked it for my in-laws who had flown in from New York and they were absolutely in love! They had never used Home Away before so they were quite hesitant at first and didn't really understand the concept but now, they have already decided this is the place they will stay for every visit. The location is ideal - situated in a cozy, quiet little neghborhood but in the center of everything at the same time. The skyline view is exactly what you see in the pictures but better in person! This little guest house was clean, updated and wonderfully air conditioned. Susana is friendly, helpful, and quick to respond to any questions you might have. She was so hospitable too - she had coffee, bottled water in the fridge and a bottle of wine waiting for my in-laws to enjoy! She welcomed them but then they never saw her again, and enjoyed complete privacy. Book this place... you'll be very happy! Thanks Susana!

"
2297,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3466675#reviews,"May 2, 2014",5/5,Perfect little place for a quieter Austin stay!,"I feel so lucky to have found this place! I was initially going to stay on my own while attending a conference downtown. I'm more than happy to walk, ride a bike, or take public transportation, and after a very loud rental experience in downtown a few years ago, I thought I'd explore another Austin neighborhood. I felt safer knowing that the owner was in the main house. This adorable little property is well outfitted for a small group; I wound up having a friend stay with me and attend the same conference, and we were plenty comfortable, each with a little private space in the evening. We were able to prepare breakfast at ""home,"" and take a beautiful walk along the lake to the conference center (about 1.5 miles away). There are lots of places to rent bikes nearby, including an Austin B-cycle station about a block away (bike share with auto payment/rental and lots of stations around town). There are lots of great places to eat and shop nearby, including a local grocery around the corner and the flagship Whole Foods about a block away. We loved sitting on the balcony and enjoying Austin's cooler evenings with a glass of wine and a view of downtown. We never used a car once we got there (though we were blessed with great, if warm, weather)! The owner is also great - she answered emails quickly and had great suggestions, as well as a warm welcome. I would suggest adding another sharp knife or two, and maybe some bigger/deeper/differently shaped bowls (for cereal), but I think if I'd asked the owner while we were there they'd have appeared! (Oh, and maybe instructions for the A/C/ units? I'd never used those before and thought I had them working, but only had the fan on until my friend arrived and explained them to me - they work great, I just didn't know what I was doing!) The neighborhood is quiet and friendly but very close to the nightlife of Austin. I live in Florida and only get to Austin when I have a professional need to do so, but I would absolutely stay here again and highly recommend it.

Nice fixtures and fittings, comfortable lounge space upstairs and well-equipped kitchen on the ground floor. Sound system was more than adequate for the space, as was the TV/cable set-up - but I didn't use it that much because the view (a little marred by the neon-bright 24-hour McDonald's) from the Downtown-facing, VERY private deck was spectacular. Walking distance to great resto's (Odd Duck, Barley Swine, Henri's, etc), an easy bus ride ($1), from a very close bus stop, into Downtown with a very nice market and super BBQ just a few steps away. Owner Susana was delightful (I only met her when I arrived which was perfect) and flexible on check-in and out timing. This was the first time I had stayed out of the of Downtown SXSW, and it was a true oasis ($10 cab ride) away from the craziness, so glad I did, and will definitely be happy to return next year! A couple thngs that could be improved (hence 4 stars): Hooks! Hooks on the back of the bathroom door. Hooks for hats/jackets. Hooks for damp towels... Hooks, and plenty of them! And for that true touch of luxury, a King bed would be an easy and much appreciated upgrade. But I had a fantastic time and would recommend this property to anyone looking for privacy that's handy for Downtown!

Had a great vacation! Was a little worried when booking since I had some questions and didn't get a quick response. After a few emails they did answer my questions though and really came through by allowing us to check in an hour early (short notice) so my son could work in a quiet space! Beds were comfortable, neighbors quiet and great location. I was concerned when looking at other reviews about the tricky driveway and stairs being slick. I'm so glad we booked this home anyway because neither one is an issue. There were already staple items like laundry soap, cleaning products, sugar,coffee etc so that was a plus and in turn we left items we purchased that hopefully others can use as well. Home was clean - only issue was that the dishwasher was full with the last guests dishes but not a big deal. Dishwasher and stove were a little tricky to start but could easily be overcome if you read the book. Would highly recommend!

We stayed three nights in Park Lane and enjoyed it very much. My wife attended a conference at the JW Marriot on 2nd and Congress. With three teenage children we did not want to be confined in a hotel room. The Park Land is about 10 minutes from the Marriot even in traffic. It was simple to drop her off and pick her up. We were able to have privacy and plenty of bathroom space. The house is comfortable and well appointed. The kitchen is great. We had no issues with anything. South Congress restaurants and shops are a five minute walk away. I would highly recommend walking to SoCo. Parking along Congress looked like a challenge at best. If I had to find a negative it would be that the stairs are steep and made from dark wood. They do blend in to each other and make it difficult to see the next step especially in the dark. The solution to this is to turn the lights on over the stairs, but I would not recommend allowing small children to use the stairs unaccompanied. My teens had no problems. One final complaint that has nothing directly to do with the house: the driveway is very steep and my car scraped every time I pulled in. That said, it was only scraping on a plastic air dam and not any body parts, so no harm done. Just an unpleasant sound. On the subject of sound, this house is in a very quiet neighborhood. As close as it is to SoCo you can't hear anything from the bedrooms. Very quiet and restful. Finally, the house was very clean.

The entire process from booking through our departure was easy. The property manager was very friendly and always quick to respond. The pictures and description do not do the house justice. It extremely well kept, beautiful, full of character, and modern. Each room had its own balcony and bath. Then location puts you right in the heart of South Congress. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.

The house was absolutely perfect in every way. I do have a minor suggestion. The steps on the stairway are difficult to see, particularly on the way down. I would suggest you finish the stairs with a stain that is easier to see or place some identifying mark on each stair to prevent accidents.

I rented this house for 8 nights with my husband and 2.5 year old because it's conveniently located to shopping, food, and groceries - all within walking distance. The house was fully stocked with all the necessities: bath essentials, paper towels, toilet paper, coffee/creamer/sugar, bags, extra blankets, and etc. Most places I've rented very seldom supply you with all of that, so that was a PLUS. Whoever cleaned the house upon our arrival did a great job because it was spotless when we arrived and it made me feel at ease, especially traveling with a toddler who likes to be all over the place. Another added bonus was the parking permits. Over the weekend, we had 2 other families with children stay with us, and they've all enjoyed it very much. Online mentioned there was only 1 parking permit if needed to park on the street, but fortunately there was a total of 3, which allowed our guests to be able to park on the street close by to the house. The patio area, the balconies, and overall house was very kid friendly (aside from the stairs). My 2.5 year old son enjoyed nightly strolls down to south congress for Amy's ice cream, and tells me he wants to ""go back to live in the Austin house."" I would definitely come back here again!

"
2325,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3468663#reviews,"Jul 25, 2016",5/5,Experience everything!,"Stayed in home for a few days to attend a UT college visit and worked w/Brooke, who was friendly & nice! There were 6 of us and the house was the perfect size to accommodate us all! So much room that none of us felt cramped at all...and honestly, so modern & cool, the pics don't do it justice!

They DO have a Keurig, even though their description just says 'coffee maker', so that was a nice, unexpected find. We shopped right down the street at HEB for little things like half & half, Splenda & adult beverages, however, we ate out at almost all our meals since SoCo was right down the street.

SoCo, by the way, is legit about a block & a half away and located where some of the BEST pizza & Mexican food could be found...if you can't find something good to eat within walking distance of the house, I worry about ya :) There were also plenty of little & big named shops along SoCo, for those that love to shop while on vacay. Warning for those with heat or sun-sensitivity...Austin is straight up HOT & humid in July, so fair warning to take LOTS of water when you leave to go to SoCo and wear super comfortable shoes.

The house was in a great location to other things too! We were a 10 min drive to Barton Springs pool (which is FREEZING!), 3 min from Congress St. Bridge to view bats (around 8:30p) & it took us 15 min to drive through downtown to get to UT.

Now that was all the good stuff...there were a few things I thought could have been better but it all had to do with the ""make ready"" process. The cleaning or stocking crew should ensure coffee for the Keurig is available for the next guests (there were 2 unopened boxes of decaf but the regular coffee box was there empty), make sure the lights on the walking path all work at night (there are these really cool metal walking ""pads"" that can be a little difficult to maneuver at night when the lights don't work...we used our iPhones' flashlight to help) and that the tree next to the parking space is kept trimmed out of the pathway (I'm 5'2"" and I ran into that darned tree the entire visit). Again, though, the pluses totally outweigh the negatives at this home and we're still super happy we rented it!!

The location was excellent, the house beautiful in terms of layout and furnishings, and property management/access was good. We had two little ones with us and appreciated that there were 2 cribs and high chairs (although we only knew in advance about availability of 1 of each, so brought a portable crib and had overweight luggage bringing high chair). We had some friends over for dinner, and parking was a bit of a problem, with only 1 guest parking permit (friend almost got a ticket 15 minutes after arrival). The 1 parking place was somewhat blocked by a tree that needed pruning. The property was clean, well-maintained ( a bit of dirt in fridge- should have been cleaned more thoroughly). It was a bit confusing which trash cans to use, despite the notebook of rules. All in all, the property worked well for us ( 3 couples, 2 small children), and we would definitely rent it again.

It was my first time with AirBnB and I outdent have been happier. It was much less than a hotel, and a much better experience. Staying in a private residence enhanced our trip feeling much more connected to the community than hotel. The house had everything needed to enjoy our stay. We were group of 3 so their was plenty of room and space. The neighborhood is was very quiet and we were just two blocks from SOCO which is loaded with all types of restaurants. We couldn't have selected a better location. The house was amazing! The photos reflected exactly what the house looked like. Every last detail was addressed including the binder with everything you would need to know about the house. The lock box with the keys, the parking, parking pass, cable TV etc. We cant say enough about this home, we highly recommend it and would stay their again in a heart beat.

The house was clean and well-appointed, with TVs in the living room and each of the bedrooms, plenty of dishes etc, and a large capacity washer/dryer. Beds and linens were comfy. The owners, Tony and Julie, live on the property and were always available and accessible if we had questions or needs. We had some technical difficulties with internet access and television remotes, but Julie was always there in a heartbeat to help. I wouldn't necessarily recommend for people with young children unless you bring a gate! I was chasing my little guys up and down the stairs all day long;) (Julie can recommend a place for renting baby/child equipment like high chairs, etc.) However, this is a perfect place for a family gathering or a reunion with friends. Not only a beautiful house, and one you're happy to just hang around, but easy walking distance to SoCo, downtown, the Town Lake Trail and all things Austin. We loved it so much we stayed an extra week!

We booked and couldn't have been happier with our choice. The property was beautiful. It is just a couple of blocks off of S. Congress, yet the neighborhood is very quiet. There are three bedrooms, each with their own bathroom and television which gave us each our own space. Julie was very helpful throughout our stay, and she provided us with a great guide to explore the S. Congress neighborhood. We were very happy with our stay. If we ever find ourselves coming to Austin again, we will definitely stay here again.

Julie and Tony were a pleasure to work with, and the fact that they live next door made everything easy peasy! The condition of the property and the furnishings are great, and the location near South Congress — Joe's coffee in the morning, and Home Slice pizza and Guero's at night — enables an authentic Austin experience.

The purpose of our visit was to look at homes, as we're planning a move to Austin soon, and we're now ""sold"" on Travis Heights. Thanks, Julie and Tony!

I can't say enough good things about the house, the owner, and the location. Julie met us immediately upon our arrival and reviewed everything we needed to know about the house. We told Julie we were going to host a dinner for our son (a UT student -Hook 'em Horns!) and his roommates early in the week. Julie was very accommodating to our group's needs - even bringing over extra chairs, cookware, and bowls from her own home! In advance of our stay, she emailed us info on her favorite restaurants and entertainment venues nearby. All recommendations were spot on! We drove down from the Dallas area, so we had a car. But really, a car is not necessary as there are restaurants, shopping, trails, etc. all within walking distance. The home is comfortable and beautiful, allowing everyone privacy while still providing an intimate setting. I highly recommend this place!

Plus you are just across the lake from downtown. This immaculate 3 bedroom home is perfect for families or a group of friends looking to explore Austin or attend an event like ACL or SXSW.

The home is very modern and upscale. Everything from the furniture to the electronics are high-end. Each bedroom has their own private bathroom and deck access. The kitchen is top notch and well equipped. If you like to cook there is the Farm to Market grocery on South Congress, or you could venture out to Whole Foods (5th/Lamar) or Central Market (38th/Lamar) for a bigger shopping experience. There is a large dinning table that seats six.

The house is impeccable - absolutely gorgeous interior, very comfortable beds, great light, modern and nice amenities of all sorts.... We were right at home and sad to leave!! The location is perfect - literally right in the heart of SOCO. We walked everywhere and easily took cabs downtown at night and again to/from the airport. Super easy. We cooked a delicious meal in the beautiful kitchen one night and lounged in the oasis outside to cool off under the shade in the afternoon Austin heat.

Firstly the owners, Julie and Tony were very friendly and helpful answering any questions we had prior to booking making the whole process smooth and easy. The house itself was modern and spacious, exactly what we were looking for since we had a group of 9 staying. It easily accomodated all 9 of us and Julie and Tony provide a very comfortable queen air mattress as a 4th bed. The location is ideal for experiencing one of Austin's best streets, South Congress Avenue which was literally a 2 minute walk from the house. There are loads of great restaurants, bars, vintage shops, markets on S congress and we walked over there most days. It is also very close to downtown Austin, Zilker park, Barton Springs and other cool Austin spots. Overall, the house was perfect for our weekend stay and i would definitely consider staying here again should we end up organising something similar in future.

There was also a lot of food trucks within walking distance!

The house was just as the pictures showed. We were delighted to find it large, open, clean, and filled with a welcoming comfy yet airy atmosphere throughout. Bathrooms were huge and beautiful. The bedrooms were large and clean, and the home overall offered the little necessities that are much appreciated when needed - like hair dryers, Tylenol and the complimentary Welcome wine that Julie and Tony left for us our first day. The inside and outside of this home was beautiful and I wold stay there again and suggest it to others - absolutely.

From the very beginning the owners were helpful and accommodating, they provided directions from the airpot and allowed us to stay beyond our check-out time to accommodate a late departing flight.

Very clean, comfortable, 2 bedroom, 2 bathrooms. Great AC, lots of fans and big TV for relaxing after a busy day of sightseeing. Paul recommended the Cafe Java which we loved, very busy, great service and good fresh food. The pool is not heated and the weather was not hot enough for us to take a dip and unfortunately the hot tub was not heated either when we went to use it. Paul was very responsive by text and said he would call right away, he also responded quickly when we had other questions even though they had just had a new baby. This is not downtown which we liked but close enough with a rental car. The traffic was not as bad as we see in Portland, Oregon. We rented electric bikes at Rocket Rentals on Lady Bird Lake, this was a highlight! They have motors which can take you up to 20mph if you need it as well as 7 speeds. We spent all day on these bikes.

Great city we found the people so nice and even all the dogs were nice! The Walnut creek park near by was great for jogging. They are constructing a walkway through this green belt so there was some construction not on the weekend and they start at 0730 am but we did not find it annoying. We did wear earplugs which we always travel with a couple times. We could also hear the people upstairs walking around some but not bad. Very secure and we would recommend your condo without hesitation!

There is plenty of on-street parking, even a few spots that had shade. It is very clean and well-decorated, with original photos taken by the owner on display, which is unique and gave the place a fun vibe. There was plenty of space for all of us to store our luggage, comfortably move around, and enough dishes and towels for the 5 day stay. Wi-Fi is fast. There is a very efficient cooling system and recycle bins are provided. The location is in a quiet neighborhood, and the attached patio is a nice place to sit in the evenings. The bathroom is located in a loft that is accessible only by a somewhat steep ladder, it was not a problem for us but could be for young children and elderly.

Jana is very friendly and helpful - she pointed out a fun neighborhood bar and the original Torchy's Tacos - both were less than a 5 minute walk away and we frequented the bar enough to learn our bartender's name :). She also gave us pointers on how to best get to the SoCo area (walkable, but it is a long walk in the summer heat), and recommended a few ""can't miss"" locales.

We had a great time in Austin and we truly enjoyed this rental - we will stay again if we are lucky enough to visit Austin in the future!

We enjoyed a local cider one afternoon on the large patio and met her lovely dogs, Cliffy and Barkley. We even saw the small neighborhood flock of guinea birds on our way to South Congress st, from which we could either walk or catch local transit to the Soco district, the waterfront statue of SRV and Sixth st.

Our dog not only loved the space, but also Jana's two dogs became fast friends. Whether it was telling us where to go, giving us a spare key, showing us a dog park, and even loaning tools to fix a bicycle (and helping with the repairs,) Jana was always there for us in a truly above a beyond manner.

On street parking was a plus, as it seems parking is a premium almost everywhere in Austin. The place was vey cute and well apportioned. We had everything we needed and enjoyed our downtime here. It was very close to the South Congress Avenue shops and stores as well as right down the road from the downtown Austin area. The bathroom is located on the second floor loft, which is accessed by a steep stair so this wouldn't be a great place for my parents or anyone who has some difficulty climbing steep steps - but for us, this place was perfect.

Fun to navigate the stairs up to the bathroom (although our dog had no idea where we went when we went upstairs--for her, it was like we disappeared into a portal.) Our dog also loved her stay, and we were grateful that we could bring her for her first visit to the city and not have to board her. Jana was very sweet and recommended a great taco place.

It is in a very safe part of Austin where we always felt comfortable walking. You can walk to several grocery stores, restaurants, bars, coffee and juice shops in the area.

Deirdre was very kind and flexible, working with our schedule and our pets (3 dogs) which very few home owners would entertain. The house is nicely furnished and decorated while still feeling comfortable and laid back - like you're at home. The kitchen is fully loaded with dishware and utensils, which was great for us as we cook a lot. The house has a nice sized back yard and gardeners who maintain it as well. Deirdre made our stay easy going from beginning to end - the only hard part was leaving Austin!

The furniture was beautiful and comfortable, the reading library was eclectic, the pictures and nicknames sprinkled throughout the home were like a daily treasure hunt of surprises. We came to visit with our sons for the holidays, and this home afforded us the opportunity to spend time together in a charming setting and enjoy the surroundings. The location was also within walking distance as well as a very short driving distance to anything you could possibly want. We walked for morning coffee, around the very nice and very safe neighborhood and drove minutes to downtown, restaurants, the grocery, shopping, bars, the hospital, holiday events. And it took very little time to go to the lake for lunch and the many parks in Austin. But I think one of the best things about this property is Deirdra, the owner and host. She treats her guests like family, providing thorough instructions, directions, and answers any and all questions quickly. When you rent online, you are never really sure what you are going to get but with Deirdra, you can be assured that she has your best interests at heart and truly wants her guests to love Austin and her home as much as she does. I have traveled extensively and always rented homes instead of staying in hotels. I can honestly say this was the best overall rental experience I have ever had. Deirdra, I would give you 10 stars if I could! Karen L.

The booking process was very easy, (somewhat of an achievement in itself for a UK resident booking a US property!) and the check-in was quick, efficient and introduced me to my charming host!

Over the next five weeks I found the house to be perfect for my needs, and in an area of Austin that is perfect for any visitors. Downtown is ten minutes away, even in the heaviest traffic, and there are numerous retail and dining establishments nearby that make the neighborhood perfect - i particularly recommend Central Market on Lamar for your food and drink, and Kerbey Lane cafe for its queso...

I loved the way the air conditioner made the house completely cool in August, the warmest part of the summer. I also found that the location was excellent for avoiding Austin traffic. During off hours, MoPac was fast. I found myself always arriving earlier than I expected. When MoPac was congested, I took Lamar, which was very easy. I never heard noise from MoPac. The home had air purifiers that provided white noise so I slept very well every night. The beds and linens were high quality. I felt safe because in this neighborhood the only people I saw walking were moms taking their children to or from school. The surrounding homes are very nice; it's an established neighborhood. The kitchen was well equipped and decorated so cheerfully. Others have commented on how helpful Deidre is about making sure that if I had any questions, she was available to answer them. I agree. She was so organized I really didn't have any questions. She is a perfect lessor. I cannot fully express how the home exceeded my expectations.

The owner provides every amenity, including top quality cooking pans and utensils, lovely glassware and dishes, washer and dryer, - and the owner remains available for questions if any should arise. I texted Deirdre one evening to ask about neighborhood breakfast options before an early meeting the next day. She not only recommended a great restaurant, but also gave me ""local knowledge"" shortcuts that made my morning commute easier.

If the pricing were in line with the quality, then my list of complaints would be much shorter. (We have stayed in other VRBO homes within a couple of miles that were much more luxurious for less cost).

Pros:

Master bed comfortable; Room quiet and dark, and we slept well while we were here. The location is good; close to downtown, yet on the edge of one of the best neighborhoods in town. When we asked for something, Deirdre tried to comply. Originally house did not have a coffee pot, microwave or standard cable. She agreed to add all of these things. She also returned our full deposit even though our dog had chewed a pillow, and the deposit was returned quite promptly.

Cons:

House is in disrepair; 40’s bungalow needs to be gutted and updated. Plaster cracking, paint peeling, window glazing cracking throughout. Day light streams in through closed doors, which do not close properly. This leaves the house very humid; clothes never quite dry. Secondary bedroom smells like mildew/must. I couldn’t be in that room for more than a few moments at a time. Appliances low end. One 21” TV and uncomfortable chairs so we never were really comfortable except when we were sleeping. Yard is all dirt which turns to mud when it rains. Yard is full of mosquitoes which easily find their way into the house. The house is not clean. Drawers have old liners in them which make everything in them feel dirty; utensils were sticky. The kitchen was so inadequate and unclean that in 5+ weeks we didn’t cook even once.

Not sure who could give this house a 5* rating. As we checked in she told us we were her first renters, yet there were quite a few 5* reviews on VRBO. It was not equipped properly to be a rental either, only 4 towels, 4 plates, etc. We counted down the days to leave. It was not a good fit for us. For the price paid, we were expecting more luxury and comfort.

Over the years I have stayed at several of Deirdre's properties and have always found the experience to be excellent. Out of the three homes which she offers for use I found this one to be the most tastefully appointed and comfortable.

I really can't say enough about the condition of this home, it is charmingly cozy, wonderfully clean, and convenient to almost anything you might want to do in Austin. What this house isn't is a cookie cutter suburban home that's ""nice"" but sterile. No, this house feels like a home. Yes the floors might squeak and maybe it's not perfectly level in every spot. But that's what makes it comfortable, it is the sort of place which causes you to think ""wow, I could really see myself living here, this feels like home"".

It is a peaceful and quiet house. It is very clean and the backyard is the perfect place for an early morning breakfast. The kitchen was just right for cooking quick meals. Deirdre had several thoughtful touches - extra soap and shampoo, hair dryer - and had great advice about what do to and see in town. The bed was extremely comfortable and I loved the clean lines and simple decor of the bedroom.

I walked to a grocery store for a few staples and there are bus stops close by, if you don't have a car (which I didn't). The neighborhood is residential and felt quite safe.

The house is about 25 minutes away from the downtown. The property is located on the grounds of the Cera-Mix studio that produces handmade tile for kitchens and baths, as well as the dinnerware, plates, and bowls you'll get a chance to use in the kitchen. You'll recognize the property from the outside as the mailbox and entryway gate are covered with tile from the studio.

The bathroom is spacious, with a rainfall shower and bench seating area. The sleeping area is right next to the kitchen, and has an oven and stove for cooking. If you're lucky, you may find eggs in the fridge, fresh from the chicken coop, to use for breakfast or cooking. There's a laundry facility adjacent to the casita which you can also use and there's an outdoor seating area on the front porch. Overall, this place comes highly recommended for solo travelers or couples looking for a getaway, or something slower paced than the city.

But what we didn't know right away, was that the incredibly talented artist was the property owner. In plain sight and hidden in the magical gardens were her sculptures made right there in her studio on the property. Each piece had its own personality that came alive through facial expressions and color! The handmade tiles were vivid and bright about the property! There were chickens in there color cleanly coop to greet us as we walked under a lit twig trellis to the Casita!

 Inside the Kaseeta was just as magical through color and handmade pottery. The handmade tiles were so bright & colorful in the shower, you felt like you were showering and beautiful artwork! The kitchen was full of any utensil you need to cook just about anything, but the coolest thing was all the handmade plates & cups! The porch was the perfect place to sit and have any meal..

Unique and very ""Austin"" experience. Would advise would-be renters that the bed is quite soft and the road to the property is much better navigated by 4-wheel drive or an SUV as there are some deep ruts and rough spots. The casita was very clean and well-appointed. Also should note that it would be difficult to navigate for anyone with significant mobility issues as there are steps to/from the bathroom inside the casita and a pathway from the parking area to the front porch.

I brought 2 small dogs who felt right at home. I also felt comfortable and safe, and inspired by the great people and climate in Austin. I loved the easy access to suburban shopping including Whole Foods in Bee Cave. A couple miles away is the wonderful Commons Ford park on Lake Austin. It has peaceful trails, and a large field by the lake where the dogs love to romp and lay in the sun. Also nearby is the world class dog park...Red Bud Isle. It's worth the occasional wait for parking. Both the people and dogs are friendly and easy going. I love the nice little kitchen in the Casita...great for cooking the awesome fresh vegs and bison from WF, Austin is wonderful and the Casita helped me enjoy it.

The price is really good too considering how popular Austin is right now. It is on the same property as the owners who were always around and available to answer questions. Yet the house felt private because of the trees. There were times when I asked myself what I wanted to do that day in Austin and the answer was sit on the shady deck and read a book. It was hard to leave the house. The pool is behind the main house. It is less private but it is a lot better than a crowded resort or hotel pool. I rented the house a couple weeks before arrival and recieved quick response from Claudia. And after my stay my pet deposit was refunded in a timely manner.

The location was great for checking out the hill country but still close to town. The rental it self is small but very comfortable and had the best stocked kitchen of any rental we have stayed in, and that is a lot. Claudia came to greet us shortly after our arrival and helped us with one special request that we had. Otherwise she was around but left us to enjoy ourselves. The only suggestion I have would be a clock on one of the walls. I slept closer to the door so had no outlet for my phone, which is also my watch, so during the night or early morning I had to get up if I wanted to know the time.

I would surely recommend this for one or two people.

From the moment I arrived I felt welcome and well taken care of. The Casita was just as it looked on the website plus all the surrounding charm you hoped for. Tucked away in the hills off Bee Caves Road you could get to downtown Austin in 20 - 30 minutes depending on time of day. All kinds of restaurants, shops & malls within 5 to 15 minutes. The Casita is pet friendly so I was able to take my little dog and I think she had even more fun than I did. Cute fenced in yard so she could run all around and not bother anyone. Claudia made sure to have the Casita lights on if I was out after dark, Fresh eggs available by the properties own chickens, darling pool area to relax and read books and great tin roof to listen to the rain - so relaxing! Only tips: I would take your own pillow if you like down ones & if you are a TV person take a chrome cast stick as there are only 4 channels as Claudia discloses. It was actually kind of nice not having the TV on all the time like I do at home. We can't wait to go back!! Thank you agian for your hospitality, Charlotte

We knew she was an artist, but had no idea to what extent her whimsical creations would inspire and delight us. Claudia carefully designed the buildings on the property to capitalize on the special qualities of the surroundings. For example, two large cisterns receive water from elaborate rain-collecting systems, decorated with colorful life-sized human sculptures. Construction materials on the site include local rock, dirt pressed into hard blocks, wood, and Claudia's imaginative mosaics.

We enjoyed looking in on Claudia's ceramics studio and touring her beautiful home. We also loved just hanging out in the quiet casita, eating from Claudia's uniquely patterned pottery dishes and sleeping in the comfortable, queen-sized bed. Even the bathroom tiles reflect Claudia's artistic flair.

If you're looking for accommodations in Austin that will pique your sense of artistic wonder you'll be delighted with Claudia's sweet casita.

It is lovely to stay where energy efficiency, recycling, and composting--as well as ART--are the norm. The amenities such as great coffee, eggs, beach towels, ceiling fan, and patio furniture were much appreciated. (We used the beach towels as padding for the kitchen chairs and the outdoor chairs.)

We knew that we wouldn't be going out on Christmas Eve and Christmas (except for the local candlelight and music service at the nearby Conscious Harmony church), so we chose this cottage for its charm, local walks, and wifi. It was a good decision. If we'd been in a hotel, we couldn't have cooked, and we might have gone stir-crazy. The clear instructions/reminders on the refrigerator and in the binder for our check-out day were very helpful.

We found it pleasant to shop at the Whole Foods (Hill Country Galleria Center) and the CVS that were about 6 miles west. Most of our friends and family live on the west side of Austin, so our location was ideal. We quickly reached the Clarksville neighborhood to dine with friends at two great gluten-free restaurants there. One of them, Zocalo sells gluten-free tamales at Christmastime, so we purchased a dozen for our holiday meals; they were delicious and easy to steam. We left the steamer we purchased for the use of future guests--and for our next visit to Austin!

The cottage is nestled in a grove of oaks, near the top of hill along the side of the large property. It has a private gated walkway leading past the chicken coop to the inner garden. From there you’ll step onto the roomy, covered porch.

Inside you’ll find a well equipped kitchen with a fridge and stove. Fresh eggs were waiting for us and coffee with a French press. We like to cook so we dined in every night. There are Pots, pans, plates, tools, knives etc. The Local HEB is only 10 minutes away. Take a look through the cabinets and you’ll find the essential condiments as well.

There is a flat screen TV, wireless internet; a queen size bed, a sofa, small work and dining table; also, there is a nice patio table on the deck. The bathroom is fully tiled and roomy with a large walk in shower. Nice fixtures for the vanity sink. The outside shed has a washer dryer. We really didn’t need anything. We sipped our wine in the quiet evenings and enjoyed the solitude.

We took the dogs walking through the Commons Ford Park 5 minutes away. It is a wildlife preserve park along the riverside with winding trails for biking or jogging. There were plenty of deer and birds.

Our host Claudia was gracious and there to greet us and show us the amenities. Before we departed we toured her pottery studio. You’ll find examples of her colorful art in the bathroom tiles, the kitchen dishes, and in statues on the property.

It is a small but well planned space. If you want to get away from it all and still be 20 minutes from downtown. This is the place!

My husband and I were looking for an escape from the cold and Austin came to mind. In my search for a place, I came across La Casita. It proved to be a peak experience - a small home of our own in what felt like rural hill country but was only a 20 minute drive to downtown Austin.

Our Casita was one room with a bed, comfy sofa, table and chairs and a small but functional kitchen. You go down several steps from the main room to a great bathroom. It was comfortable and met all our needs.

I especially liked having our own porch and small garden/yard area, and the chickens at the entry way to the property were friendly and quite - all hens so we enjoyed some eggs.

Claudia is a wonderful host. She is a potter and her studio is on the property along with her house. She was available for any questions, and we so enjoyed using her fabulous plates, cups and bowls for our breakfasts.

I highly recommend this place and will certainly return when our travels take us to Austin again.

"
2504,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3473613#reviews,"Nov 10, 2014",5/5,"Hidden, Relaxing and Lovely","The property is nestled in the beautiful hills area of Austin that is a must see. The guesthouse shares the lot with Claudias mainhouse and charming pottery studio but yet, it retains its privacy well.

The room is cozy and efficient with a modern upgrade. Perfect for a couple that enjoys nature integrated with comfortable living.

Claudia is a gracious host and we felt very comfortable with her around, although we hardly ran into her during our 2 night visit. She let us use her charming custom swimming pool that resembles a fountain/pool you may see outside a fancy building but it's surrounded instead by a cozy shaded area complete with hammock and lounge chairs. Be sure to check out her pottery studio if you can catch her there so you may appreciate all the beautiful ceramics she's placed all over the property including the cottage.

Excellent stay and we will definitely return if we are visiting Austin again. Thanks Claudia!! :)

2505,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3473613#reviews,"Oct 16, 2014",5/5,Loved this hidden gem!,"We spent 5 nights in this lovely Casita and we could not have picked a better spot! We arrived very late in the evening to find the garden and porch lit with outdoor lights and the fridge stocked with the basics (what a treat!).

The Casita was very clean and came with all amenities described in great working order. We made use of the Casita, outdoor porch, garden, pool and BBQ. The chickens were much quieter than expected and the whole place just gave off a great and relaxing vibe.

Claudia (& Tuffy) were gracious hosts who were very welcoming but also gave us our privacy.The grocery store, liquor store and other shops were only a few minutes away and downtown Austin is about 15-20min.

My boyfriend and I would recommend this place to someone looking for a little getaway without a doubt!

We brought our 7 year old (note: it was made clear that there is only one bed and we were okay with that). We decided not to take our dog at the last minute, but he was welcome there nonetheless.Every morning we greeted the chickens - and they greeted us! Funny that they ended up being a highlight! The grounds are lovely, the ceramic artwork everywhere is amazing. We saw deer and fawns at dawn and dusk (along the drive). And still had modern and comfortable amenities. I highly recommend the fantastic lap pool too. Claudia was welcoming and helpful. On the last morning she loaded us up on veggies from the garden and freshly laid eggs for a breakfast scramble!

Overall, the cottage was nice and the price is right.

The owner was very nice and went out her way to get the internet to work. Although it is on the owner's property the Casita sits back and away so there is a lot of privacy. There are live chickens and fresh eggs in the fridge and that was very cool. It was off the beaten path off Bee Caves Road but it only too me 10 minutes to drive to work at Bee Caves and MoPac. I would like to stay in the summer to use the pool. Thanks Claudia!

Even our pooch, who trends toward the anxious side, gave the casita two paws up. Thanks for the fantastic weekend!

2510,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3473613#reviews,"Nov 17, 2013",5/5,A hidden gem in the Texas Hill country,"Casa Alegre is the perfect combination of modern meets quaint all placed in a setting that nurtures rest, relaxation, and creative growth. The cabin is incredibly roomy with a queen size bed, comfy sofa, breakfast/work table, full kitchen, beautiful bath, and great closet/storage area. I cooked every meal in the kitchen during my week-long stay, and it had everything I could ever need, was very functional, and all brand new! The washer and dryer attached to the cabin was a great bonus for me. I spent most my time lounging on the private front porch and garden areas. The chickens were my closet neighbors, and their eggs combined with my pickings from the vegetable garden let me eat as local as possible. Claudia is the most gracious host, always willing to give you a tour of the beautiful grounds and her world-class studio she works out of daily. Make sure to visit her gift shop!

I took daily walks around the ""neighborhood,"" and Claudia recommended some beautiful hikes that I know I will take again. For as rural as it feels at Casa Alegre, its literally just minutes from anything you should want or need: groceries, shopping, and movies are all just five minutes away, and all this just 15 minutes from Downtown Austin.

Whether you are an Austinite looking for a local getaway, or a visitor from the other side of the world, Casa Alegre will make you feel at home in the hill country, with new, stylish design, every modern convenience, and privacy that makes you feel like it is all your own. I can not wait for my next visit!!

It was very isolated yet close enough to the city for a quick trip in (we spent one day in Zilker park). All the little details were perfect. We loved the cozy cottage, custom ceramics, swimming in the lap pool, and the chickens… their fresh eggs were delicious! Another amazing treat was the fresh cedar mulch around the property. It smelled amazing! The owner was very nice & helpful and we would definitely stay here again. Thanks for a great stay!

"
2513,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3473613#reviews,"Sep 3, 2013",5/5,"Relaxed, friendly, and comfortable","Thank you Claudia, Carter, and Taylor for a wonderful retreat from the city. The cabin was clean, well designed, and full of Claudia's pottery. Really pretty stuff.

Lake Austin is an easy drive from the property and we visited it both days of our stay. Dinner, just down the street, at Ronnie's Real Food is a unique experience. A must.

The best part of Casita Alegre is the warmth and charm of the owner, Claudia. After 2 minutes, you feel comfortable and welcome to wander the grounds. A tour of her studio was impressive and educational.

Three pieces of advice: 1) Bring a swim suit for the pool and/or lake; 2) try the fresh eggs from the chicken coop next to your cabin; and 3) leave your Ferrari at home as it would be too low to the ground to get up the relatively smooth, but unpaved driveway.

We will be back!.

Pulling into the drive, I felt like I was in wonderland with two beautiful ceramic sculptures overlooking a flowing fountain. Passing the hens, I discovered the casita which I hardly left for 2 days. A fully stocked kitchen and beautifully tiled (by Claudia of course!) bathroom were bonuses for the quiet location and comfy efficiency cabin. The best surprise was the bean bag lounge chairs on the porch where I read and napped. I did manage to explore the grounds where Claudia's ceramic sculptures and rugged gardens were everywhere - and also came upon hummingbirds and butterflies. This was the perfect ""getaway-from-it-all"" solo stay(and writer's retreat) - with an afternoon visit from my husband. I left rested and inspired by Claudia's beatiful way of seeing (and making) the world.

The owner's myriad of talents and attention to detail are immediately evident as you pass through the artistically crafted entrance, wind your way up the heavily wooded drive dotted with hidden sculpture, to arrive at what is ""Casalegre"" and your hidden ""Casita"".

The ""Casita"" in all its design perfection and intimate privacy is only minutes from Austin. Lake Austin, Lake Travis, and the Texas HIll Country. The deception is that you feel miles away at some secluded retreat. Every attention to detail, beauty and your comfort is provided for, in both the indoor and outdoor accomodations. The Casita immediately makes you feel that it is your own special, secret home. It's lovely, it's comfortable, it's perfection!

Frankly, upon my return, I plan to just retreat in the Casita and enjoy the surroundings of Casalegre. The owner is a renowned artist who studio of pottery and sculpture is on the premises, as are the evidences of her boundless talents and interests. To meet her and view her projects, accomplishments, and all the property has to offer is an experience and honor. Should you have an interest in ""green"" building construction; organic gardening design; composting; raising exotic chickens in modern, rustic, beauty; raising your own tilapia fish; water conservation; wind power; sculpture; tile or pottery; just look around. It's awe-inspriring and beautiful! Oh, and wait until you see the ""Casita"" and surroundings at night with its beautiful, subtle and functional landscape lighting! But, if you want to have complete privacy and come and go at your liesure, you will have that too. It is perfection!

Driving into the property we were immediately taken with the peaceful feeling that permeates the very air. Upon our arrival at the Casita, and the owners studio and home, we were in awe of the beautiful setting. The gardens, filled with the owners sculptures, vegetables gardens, koi ponds, and more, drew us in and made us feel like we had found a piece of heaven.

The Casita itself is a very charming place to stay. With an outdoor patio, oak trees and gardens surrounding it, it is a bit of paradise. Inside, the lodging is filled with everything a person would need for a short or long term stay. It is beautifully decorated and cozy. A plus in this Casita is the owner being a ceramic artist. Her tiles and plates decorate the place and add that personal touch that made us feel at home.

Claudia is the perfect hostess as she is so personable and friendly. Her knowledge of Austin and the surrounding area was also very helpful to us. We highly recommend staying at the Casita and we look forward to spending more time there someday soon!

This Casita manages to do that perfectly! The owner is an artist who has incorporated her work into the environment in such a way that makes it visually spectacular, even though it is nestled into a secluded property in the foothills outside Austin. The casita is furnished in a modern European style that is just perfect for a short stay, and the location worked well for both Forumla One Race activities and enjoyment of Austin's fine restaurants and shopping. The owner is a delightful host, and a true professional in every way. I'd love to keep this place a secret so it would always be available just for me, but I won't! Trust me,You'll love it!

My wife and I brought our dog, and he really enjoyed the property because it was all fenced in. The cottage was very modern with a small kitchen and the shower had this great organic soap we loved! The place has a hammock on the porch! We wanted to stay away from the city but close enough to go into Austin to go to our favorite places (25 mins). About 30 mins from Lake Travis. I think it's in a great location if you want the best of both worlds. Overall I'd give this place 5 stars. We had an amazing weekend and will definitely return.

The location was the only good thing about this house. The mattress on the downstairs front bedroom was so bad we were forced to go and buy a mattress topper to even be able to sleep on the bed. The door in the front room wound not close. There was no ice or ice maker. The hot water was so hot we burned ourselves. Very dangerous for children. The bar stools were the wrong height for the bar. Tub upstairs and downstairs would not hold water. Anywhere things could be done on the cheap it was done cheaply. Couches, kitchen ware etc.

It's also just steps away from a convenience store, a BBQ restaurant, the bike share program, as well as a little food truck area. The house was immaculate. We had a couple small repairs that needed to be made, I called them and they had someone at the house within 10 minutes to fix it. Incredible. I hope to stay here again next year.

Cleaning staff did a good job upon arrival and the house was in good order. A few minor issues were noticed (shower head inconsistent pressure, water temperature went hot/cold/hot/cold) but all-in-all a good stay.

TurnKey was great pre-arrival, calling several times to ask if we needed assistance making reservations, etc. Morning of checkout we received an email stating we had been granted late checkout of 12:00 PM instead of the normal 10:00 AM time. We left to eat breakfast and came back to get our luggage and get on the road at 11:45 AM only to find our keycode no longer worked. Called TurnKey and was on intermittent hold for 15-20 minutes. Finally they told me they would send someone to the house to let us in. 40 minutes later that person arrived and then proceeded to wait inside with us (and the cleaning lady showed up) until we left. This was very frustrating and invasive of our privacy as we had a 6+ hour car drive ahead of us so we all had to use the restroom! We were all very disappointed with the final hour of our stay, and it left a black mark on an otherwise fantastic trip!

We recently converged on Austin for a week to spend time with our 4 adult children, son-in-law, and grandbaby. This home was perfect for our Austin adventure. The location was central to many fun activities the city has to offer such as Zilker Park, S. Congress street, Barton Springs, and many restaurants.

This property was great! I read many of the reviews prior to renting this home and needless to say, I was slightly worried. However! The house was absolutely precious. Convenient location, great layout, cute decor, huge backyard, and clean! If I had to find a complaint, I would say there could have been more towels... But, we also had 8 people stay.

2543,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3477728#reviews,"Apr 25, 2017",2/5,"Great location, but shabby amenities","We booked this rental for a week during our kids' Spring Break. My 70-year-old parents also joined us. The location is great and walkable to many restaurants, Palmer Center, Zilker Park, and the lake. And also includes off-street parking, which was great. However, there is A LOT of loud truck/bus traffic (bus stop right outside house), and when we arrived there was a music festival happening close by and we could hear it in the house. The windows also rattled loudly when planes flew by.

The 3 bedroom layout was great for our family, but both of the downstairs bedrooms had very uncomfortable, squeaky beds. The downstairs bathroom shower was awful and sprayed all over the place, with poor water pressure. The ceiling fan in the downstairs bedroom also did not work. We were disappointed that there was only 1 hanger in the entire house. And only two hand towels and one washcloth could be found. And many of the white bath towels were stained. We ended up going to Target and buying our own towels.

The kitchen was well-equipped, but the dishwasher soap dispenser did not close easily. And the wine glasses, housed on an open shelf were grimy and needed a good wash before we used them. Same for some of the pots/pans.

We liked that there was a washer/dryer, but we were only left with two detergent cubes and no dryer sheets. Also had to pick these up at Target.

The furniture in the house is all very shabby, a little dirty, and mismatched, putting me in mind of a college house. I'm guessing this is a house rented for the many festivals happening in Austin. In fact, we found two ping pong balls on the floor and some red solo cups (beer pong anyone?).

We have family in Austin, and will definitely be coming back to town. But, I wouldn't rent this place again. Too expensive for the condition of it.

2544,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3477728#reviews,"Mar 14, 2017",5/5,Great home walking distance to downtown and Congress,"Four of us were in town for the SXSWedu conference and had a great stay at this house. It was clean, the wifi was strong, and there wasn't any moment where we said, ""if only the house had this."" The yard was really beautiful and the house was even nicer than we were expecting. We are fans of walking and it was an easy walk to the restaurants on Congress and to the convention center. I am sure that had we decided to take cabs around, the rides would have been cheap since it is so central. There is also a bike-share stop right down the street if we'd wanted to use that. There were plenty of good restaurants nearby and we all agree we would definitely book this property again for work or for family trips.

2545,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3477728#reviews,"Mar 6, 2017",4/5,"Not too cold, not too hot, but just right.","We had a great time at this property during our weekend in Austin. It's walking distance to downtown, and central enough for an inexpensive timeshare to just about anywhere. No amazing bells and whistles although the fitepit is nice. There's a Washers put in the backyard but we couldn't find the washers. All in all we had a good time and the house was perfect for what we needed.

2546,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3477728#reviews,"Feb 24, 2017",2/5,"Great Location, Bad Bugs.","The location was great - I was taking the Bar Exam at the Palmer Events Center across the street. However, while the house is picked up and tidy, it is not clean. The floors are dirty and worst of all, the sofa in the den and one of the beds had BUGS!!! If I there was a feasible place for us to go that would still have been within a half mile of the Bar Exam, we would have left the first night. Instead, I couldn't sleep the first night - its hard to sleep when you can feel bugs crawling on you and biting you - and spent the next three days of the exam covered in bug bites and itching.

The house can comfortably fit 6 people, and if you can get over not sleeping/being eaten alive by bugs, then this is a great spot for you.

We washed all of our sheets and clothes to help deter the bugs. My feet and ankles would still get bitten as I walked through the house. Straight up gross.

Id give this place a star for location - convenient and close to things. And a star for a functioning kitchen and a functioning washer/dryer.

(could use a new shower head in the downstairs bathroom)

"
2547,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3477728#reviews,"Nov 21, 2016",2/5,Great location at a reasonable price,"I agree with other reviewers regarding the general run-down appearance of the house interior. As another reviewer noted, the missing front porch light was also a difficulty for us, the broken chairs, and the lack of basic items. There were nice big closets, but only six wire hangers (for the six of us). The kitchen was stocked with only the very basic necessities: one kitchen hand towel, no dish towels, one dirty dish sponge, nothing to store leftovers in (tupperware or foil or wrap), no ice cube tray... The mold on the windowsill in the shower and the tub handle was pretty gross (also noted by the previous reviewer. We also lost sleep in the front bedroom due to rats running and gnawing behind the wall - very noisy! (They're not in the house, but in the wall behind the bedroom.) They were also above the ceiling in the upstairs closet. The positives are the price and the great location and the nice living room(s) to hang out in. I submitted a cleaning review with some of these concerns and they contacted me right away, which was nice. Unfortunately we had already left the house. It seems like they would have supplied us with some more of these items (e.g. hangers, dish towels) if we had requested them during our stay. I didn't think of asking while we were there. Hopefully they have dealt with the rodent issue.

"
2549,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3477728#reviews,"Oct 18, 2016",3/5,Indifferent,"We loved the house itself. Nice layout, spacious. But a lot of things were broken. Most of the chairs outside and 2 dining chairs were broken. My friend almost fell backwards in a chair outside. Also the towel rack in the master was on it's last leg. It couldn't even hold a towel. The coffee table in the living room was super wobbly too. The house has definitely been used and abused. Both shower curtains had mold on the bottom too.

The description claims a fully stocked kitchen but I disagree. There were no pots for boiling water and no measuring cups or spoons. It was equipped for very basic cooking needs.

My main concern was that there was no porch light. It was pitch black in front of the house which made it difficult to walk up and down the uneven stairs with no handle. Very dangerous! We had to use our phone flashlights every time to press the code for keyless entry and to guide us to the street.

Other than the issues above, the house was great. The location was great and I appreciated the keyless entry. If you're not a chef and don't need luxury then I would recommend this house.

2550,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3477728#reviews,"May 9, 2016",4/5,Perfect location in austin,"This house was in the center of Austin, just minutes from downtown by uber and plenty of bike ride hot spots! Plenty of awesome food spots near by, bike rentals and bus stops. Walking distance to major parks. The interior was good too, shower on mainfloor has very little pressure, but upstairs is total opposite. Grass had not been mowed in a while but fire pit was still a good hangout spot. Plenty of clean towels and sheets and toiletries! I would stay here again!

"
2551,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3477728#reviews,"Apr 25, 2016",2/5,"Nice location, but quite dated","This cute house is located nicely near several area attractions and parks within Austin, and is close to bus routes as well. The house had everything the listing mentioned, and coming-and-going was easy with the keypad entry. The exception to this is that the description of ""3 bedrooms"" is a bit mis-leading, as the master bedroom is a loft that is open to the rest of the house. So yes, it has 3 bedrooms, but only two with privacy.

I gave the house 2 stars for several reasons. Some aspects of the house are quite dated and in need of an update, in particular the first floor bathroom. The shower is almost unusable because of the poor quality shower head, there is mold on the window sill in the shower, and the tile and wall areas are falling apart. The mirror is hung so low that if you are over 5'5"", you can't see yourself in it. When we checked in, the towels and bed sheets were still wet. I assume they were washed but not properly dried. It also looked as though the floor hadn't been swept prior to our arrival. There was a large stain on the rug in the living room that was still wet, as if they tried to clean it and gave up.

In short, its a nice location, but thats about it. For the nightly price of the house, I expected much better.

2552,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3477728#reviews,"Apr 21, 2016",5/5,Ideal location,"The location of this property can't be beat. Our family of ten (including four children ages 7 and younger) comfortably stayed here for the weekend. We walked or biked to all of our destinations around town (restaurants, parks, Cap 10k event). The house was clean, and had plenty of towels and comfortable beds. We did not cook while there, but it looked to have plenty of dishes and utensils, though I didn't notice any spices or other similar items. We brought our own portable crib, but there was one in the closet that could have been used.

I would recommend to the manager to fix the downstairs bathroom door that wouldn't latch and grease the kitchen cabinet door hinges (squeaky!).

The keyless entry is great. On the day of checkout we came back from our morning outing, though, to find that our code had been changed. I thankfully had the number to call, and the friendly customer service agent was able to give us the new code to get back in.

We would stay here again in a heartbeat!

The location of this house was great, it was easy to walk everywhere and the local bus stopped right at the corner. The yard space and fire pit were very private and fun to use. The space was well laid out and very tidy - it was a great space for the five of us. There were some issues though, mainly that the exterior light by the front door was gone - it made arriving at night and negotiating the keypad scary and hard. And the front door lock was unaligned so it was tricky to open and close. The bathrooms were tired, particularly the main floor bathroom - it was actually pretty grim. The tile and tub badly need to be replaced. Last oddity, there were no hangers. Lots of closet space, no hangers. The kitchen was well stocked, and when the dishwasher didn't turn on they were happy to help (light switch on the wall, who knew?!).

"
2555,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3477728#reviews,"Nov 16, 2015",4/5,Awesome Location,"We stayed for two nights on a weekend. I can't say enough about the location, it was very convenient and near anything downtown Austin had to offer. There were plenty of clean linens available and basic toiletries provided. The kitchen even had dishwasher soap and liquid hand soap stocked (which is great for out of towners). The house can really sleep about 8 people in beds comfortably (one queen, two twins, one full/queen pull out sofa, and one king bed upstairs), possibly 9 if one person slept on the couch in the front room. If you are a picky cook, you may want to bring your own skillet to cook in, the one provided sticks pretty bad. The driveway can fit 4 cars (stacked one in front of the other, single wide driveway), but parking is not available on the street (no parking signs were everywhere). There is a public parking garage across the street in the park, but the attendants couldn't guarantee that we wouldn't get towed if we left cars overnight. I suggest that if you are going to have more than 4 cars, to carpool or find a different parking garage around town that allows for overnight parking. Overall I would say to skip out on a hotel near 6th Street and stay here instead. The house is cute and simple, and the rental process went smoothly. Having a key pad with a code for the weekend was amazing!

What a great little (yet not so!)house this is. It was perfect in many ways: traffic flow through house, kitchen size and layout, acomodating everyone over several days, close to Zilker and bike kiosks, minutes from Mercury Hall, close to downtown. The house was clean, cool, attractive, and great towels (someone previously didn't like them). I would stay here again. It was so smart to rent this house for the wedding week.

The house was clean when we arrived. One thing I'd suggest to the owners is to provide oven mitts in the kitchen. We improvised with towels.

Great place to rent. Walking distance to downtown, South Congress, and right across the street from Auditorium Shores. The house was clean and the beds were comfy. Plenty of space inside and a nice yard for a family. One negative: I asked the rental company whether a pack and play and high chair was available for my infant. They told me the property did not have those items so I rented them. When I got there, there was a pack and play and high chair in the closet. The rental company really should know what is at the house. Just a minor issue, and more with the rental company than the house itself. Would definitely rent again!

Great fire pit in the back that I wish we got to take advantage of. There's also a bike share stop right outside the house that was really fun to do one morning. We fit 9 girls in this house very comfortably and had an amazing weekend. The team was very communicative with me to make sure the stay was great. My only (minor) complaints were that the bathrooms could use some freshening and there were not enough towels provided.

Master bath had two vanity areas, which was nice. The mirror in one area was great, the other was very small. In the large area with 2nd vanity, adding a mini fridge and coffee maker would make this even better for two family rental.

Mirror in the main bath was hung horizontally at a low level, none of us (all tall) could see our face in it without bending over. Rehang it vertically or replace with mirror that is as long as the vanity. There is plenty of counter space so more mirror space would be helpful.

The home was nice and clean when we arrived except the first floor bathroom floor being dirty. We were very satisfied and fit comfortably. It is very close to many ideal destinations in Austin which made it easy to get around. Would have liked to spend more time in the backyard but it was not very presentable and so it was not as ideal to spend time out there. The chairs were all in disarray and the grass was un-kept.

We had an amazing Austin experience in this house that we rented. The rental company was very accommodating and we absolutely loved the house. There was plenty of room to sleep, and it even had additional air mattresses in the closet, and bedding for the beds. The house was newly decorated and everything was perfect. The company allowed us to check in early, and check out later, and they did not charge us. The house sleeps 8, however we had 12 girls and managed to fit perfectly! (shared the king, two on the aero, and one slept on the sofa). I would recommend this house to girls looking to rent for a bachelorette etc. I would DEFINITELY stay here again or look into renting another house from this rental company. We all LOVED it. Aside from the house being absolutely amazing, the location was great! We were a 5 minute Uber ride away from the action and the Ubers did not cost us more than 8$ each ride. (it was typically a 5$ Uber ride) There were bikes you could rent for 24 hours across the street that only cost 10$. Definitely look into renting this house, we had a blast!

Property is in desirable location and property manager was good with updating emails and alerts. The home was a fun place to stay and served it's purpose. I have stayed in other VRBO's in the area as I visit Austin frequently. This property does need a little TLC. Bathrooms need updating, especially shower faucet in Master felt like gym shower faucet with hard spray. Other than that there were no issues and home was relaxing and inviting.

What a perfect house to stay at during our visit to Austin. It provided everything we needed for our family while in Austin for a wedding. Close to Congress street and a lll the happening bars and restaurants. Easy access to the highway. Beds and linens clean and comfortable. Great common space. I would recommend as perfect alternative to families who want more space than a hotel and more comfort.

Overall, we loved this property, but there were a few things that could be improved upon... The house is so cute inside and out. We loved how close it was to SoCo and Zilker Park. The listing advertised this house accommodating 8, which is technically true, but the sofa couch was horribly uncomfortable, dirty, and there was no bedding provided for it. The full bed was 'meh'. The king was super comfy though. The backyard is so cute! Perfect for BBQs or just hanging out. The fire pit would be awesome in cooler weather! The kitchen was fully equipped with a coffee pot, pots, pans, (no muffin pan), and tons of glasses. Overall, I would recommend this property, but bring your own towels, and bedding if you need to use the sleeper.

7 girlfriends rented this house for a weekend getaway and absolutely loved it! The house was spacious for 7 of us and the beds were very comfortable. The backyard was great to sit out on the patio, although we forgot to buy bug spray! Good location...we did not have a car, but everything was a short/cheap cab ride away or a nice (half mile/mile) walk to the places we wanted to go. We would definitely stay here again if we return!

Thank you for the great stay in Austin. This home was in a great location, very walkable to many Austin attractions. We went to Austin with 6 ladies and it was the perfect size. The decor inside was beautiful, and the patio was so nice! due to a rainy weekend, we didn't maximize the patio sadly. I also appreciated Turnkey's 24/7 response line, because I did need to call a few times. Thank you also for leaving coffee and dishes to enjoy. I appreciate a great stay- I'd recommend this rental.

The house itself was very nice with all the amenities required plus the added bonus of the internet. The major complaint we had was the fact that due to a recent storm a very large branch from a neighbours tree had snapped off and was held up by the fence at one end and at the other by a high branch from another tree. This was a very dangerous situation in that the support of said bough could have given way suddenly and without warning thus killing or injuring anyone below. The previous renters told us they had reported this problem but nothing had been done about it! As it was we did not make use of the garden because of the imminent danger. Also the front and back gardens (yards) had not been maintained at all and were a total disgrace! As it happened the owner called around unexpectedly and was more than a little upset at the garden situation! As a result of his visit a man turned up and took a number of photographs and said he see that it was dealt with. This had not happened before we left!

This was the perfect place for our bachelorette party weekend. When we arrived at this cute house, the decor and everything else in the pictures were right on and even better in person. There is a living room when you walk in and two bedrooms to the left with a shared bathroom. Then once you pass the first living room, you enter the kitchen and dining area, which is surrounded by windows. Then, adjacent to the dining area is another living room, where there is another sofa that turns into a bed. Walk upstairs to the master suite, which is where we put the bride to be along with the maid of honor. There were beautiful views with it's own balcony. There is also a quirky room surrounded by windows from the master bedroom where you climb up a ladder. The patio and backyard is beautiful. We sat outside and talked until almost dawn. It's by far the best and most memorable place we could have found. It will hold a sentimental place in our hearts. Thanks to the owners for providing this home to us. We experienced the best of Austin here.

We also felt very safe and had no problems with noisy neighbors or anything like that. We also took advantage of the beautiful backyard which had ample seating, a washers game built into the ground, and a firepit.

From the moment I made a reservation the communication with the office staff at Turn Key was amazing. They were very informative and every time I called or emailed they responded very quickly and with answers to my questions ( I had a lot). They accomodated us wanting a late check out but when there was a mix up with the maids as to what time to come I called the office at 10 am on Sunday morning and the lady that answered handled the situation so professionally. I could not have been more pleased. My only negative comment about the property is that the pull out bed was so uncomfortable that I just slept on the couch instead and there could be some more dusting done behind the couch and in certain areas of the home but other than that it was great for a group of 7 ladies. The El Alma Restaurant is great for dinner and 1/2 block walking distance. The kitchen was excellent to work in and the gas stove was a plus! There isn't an ice maker so be sure to bring your own. Loved the decor and outside fire pit! I would definitely rent this place again.

The areas that I think need attention are the cleaning crew and some updates that need to be made to the home.

I think this home could rate all 5 stars with just a little work.

We recently stayed in this home. There were 8 our party. We really enjoyed that the house was with in walking distance to shopping and dinning. The home was clean and the floor plan worked very well for us. We would stay here again, but did have a few inconveniences. There is no garbage can in the kitchen, we would place a grocery bag on the floor. The fold out sofa bed is really hard and we couldn't find any bedding for it. On our second night we did find some bedding in a locked closet, but the mattress was so hard our family member had to sleep 4 nights on the sofa. There is a very nice fire pit, but the out door furniture was covered with dust and leaves and some of the chair pads where on the ground, looked like they had not been used or cleaned in a very long time. Over all we enjoyed out stay and if the sofa bed was replaced we would come back.

This property was great for my friends and I as we were traveling from all over the United States to Austin. The keypad was great as everyone got in at different times, so we did not need to wait at the house to let people in to drop off their stuff. It also gave us a meeting space where we could hang out, both inside and out as it had a large backyard with washers built in. It was really nice to not have to cram into a hotel room to hang out with people before going out as we were able to relax and conserve our energy for the night's activities. It's a little over a mile to the 6th street bars, so we were able to walk to and from. It was also close to a few restaurants as quite a few food trucks, so getting food was never a problem if you did not want to cook. Everything was great, and I would definitely recommend staying at the house.

There was even sunscreen and bug spray provided which was a nice touch. The company was extremely professional and accommodating, letting us check out a little late and being very responsive to my emailed inquiries.

The convention center is only 1 mile away and the Ladybird trail is just across the street for your daily run. We stayed for 6 days of SXSW and never took a cab once. Loved having the washer/dryer although we didn't end up using them and the keyless entry makes thing a breeze when your group doesn't want to be joined at the hip all day. Lastly, Erica from TurnKey was THE BEST EVER. She gave a monster list of incredible recommendations for restaurants and bars in the area that were tailored to our tastes and every one of them was spot on. The property is adorable, in a prime location and perfect for a family or a few coworkers if you don't mind sharing one of the bathrooms. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

2618,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3477728#reviews,"May 7, 2013",5/5,Fantastic House and Location,"This house was perfect for our group of 8 guys looking to walk to a variety of places in Austin. Through the course of the weekend, I walked to Zilker Park, South Lamar, South Congress, South First, bars west of Congress and East 6th Street. The house couldn't be any more centrally located. Despite the proximity to everything, the house sits back on a fairly quiet street so we never felt we had to watch our noise level in the backyard.

The yard was plenty spacious for us to all hang out and the amenities were perfectly adequate. My only complaint is that one of the chairs outside was broken, but fortunately there were plenty of other places to sit. Also it would have been nice if there was more than one roll of toilet paper. It was pretty easy to get more, but the house still has to expect more than one roll will be used through the course of a stay.

The keyless doorcode was a great touch and let our group come and go as we pleased without being tethered to the guy with the key, and let us check in easily, even late at night.

Overall we loved the place. Especially for a cheap price, we couldnt have ended up with a better option for the weekend.

My girlfriends and I recently came to Austin for a girl’s weekend and stayed here. The house is exceptionally appointed and a truly relaxing place to be right in the middle of all the great things there are to do in town. Monika and Billy were both very easy to work with and also gave us great advice on some of the sights to see. We will definitely be coming back!

I found this house on Bouldin, in a great part of town, and put my parents and brother’s family up for a few days. They loved it. In fact we debated moving some of our holiday celebrations over there because the house and set up were so comfortable. Thanks for a great stay!

2621,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3477728#reviews,"Oct 30, 2012",5/5,All That and More,"I had never been to Austin before and wanted to stay in a place that was not too urban but also close to music and restaurants. This home is all that and more. The interior is tastefully decorated and well furnished. There are distinctive features like a 3rd story loft and upstairs deck. And the outside firepit is a great gathering spot with pergola, gardens and ample seating. The rear yard is well sized and picturesque - with mature plantings and trees - straight out of a postcard. And the location is perfect - quick walk to downtown, but far enough away for peace and quiet. As a successful real estate agent, I am constantly assessing properties for their curb appeal and overall aesthetic. Desirability is paramount and if I was charged with marketing this property I wouldn't need to do a thing - it's just right the way it is. I would highly recommend this house.

2622,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3477728#reviews,"Oct 3, 2012",5/5,Fantastic Location/Beautiful Home,"I rented this house with three other friends for a recent visit to Austin. We are a group of college friends in our 40s and met in Austin for a weekend of live music, great eating and catching up. It would be equally suitable if I were visiting with my family and young kids which I hope to do soon. While Austin has plenty of great hotels, we wanted to be in one house with a nice outdoor gathering spot. This house totally fit the bill and frankly the pictures do not do the property justice, especially the amazing outdoor area. We made great use of the built in fire-pit and comfortable outdoor furniture—the perfect gathering spot for late afternoon cocktails. You can walk to many bars and restaurants from here and proximity to Zilker Park is fantastic. You can tell the owners have put a lot of time and money into the house to create a special experience for guests—pride of ownership really shows here. They were also a pleasure to deal with in all respects. This is what a Homeaway rental should be—hassle free, comfortable, centrally-located and clean. I recommend this great Austin house to anyone.

2626,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3478871#reviews,"Mar 4, 2017",2/5,"Dirty, poor maintenence and security concerns","Let's start with the good things. We liked the location. Close to restaurants, downtown and the greenway, but also quiet and neighborhood-like. The house is actually kind of charming if you can get past the cleanliness and maintenance issues. Beds were comfortable. Alan communicated proactively before our arrival and promptly processed our security deposit.

On the negative side, the pictures far over-state the condition of the home. It is an old house (which is normally great for us), but is suffering from lack of maintenance and poor cleaning. The bathtub was both dirty and had grout mold. The toilet and bathroom sink was not clean. Surfaces and floors were barely clean. The cute front porch was covered in leaves, debris, and a dirty towel. We had to totally clean the bathroom and porch upon arrival. Alan let us know that he is cleaning the place instead of using professional cleaners and that explained a lot. I recommended that he go back to a professional cleaning crew.

I was also concerned about security. The front door lock is an internal lock (not an exterior door lock) and it worked poorly. The side door (main door) did have a proper lock, but I speculate that the code was not updated between visitors.

2627,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3478871#reviews,"May 18, 2016",5/5,Great location to walk Austin!,"We spent a long weekend at this house and it really met our needs. Two large bedrooms, nice open floor plan, Google Fiber for TV and WiFi, kitchen and bath with all the needs met. The neighborhood is great, almost always people out walking, running, and biking, and we had plenty of off-street parking. We walked to restaurants and food trucks on Barton Springs Road, SoCo, 1st Street, and also to the Statesman Bridge to watch the bats, plus across the river to the capital. We left our little dog at the house when she was tired of walking and she was really comfortable on Alan's couches. I enjoyed the Keurig for morning coffee. We had fun, look forward to visiting again!

2630,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3478871#reviews,"Dec 31, 2015",5/5,Texmas in Austin,"This house is just as you see it in the photos: clean, cozy and comfortable. The neighborhood is great, just a few blocks North to the river and restaurants (try El Alma for great Mexican), just a few blocks East to 1st St and more restaurants then on to South Congress, a bustling street loaded with cafes, pubs, restaurants and shops, where we were able to finish our Christmas shopping. As we were staying in the area, we didn't even need a car - we took a taxi twice to go downtown and to the Capitol but that also would be walkable in about thirty minutes.

Alan was super nice and available both by email and telephone. He answered all of our questions before we rented and once in Austin responded to the couple of questions we had immediately. He recommended restaurants and music venues and there were lots of brochures and books on Austin and the surrounding area at the house.

Our only regret is that we didn't get to see the bats as they were already vacationing in Mexico!

We would definitely recommend Alan's property to visitors looking for a nice unpretentious place in a great location.

I like Alan’s prompt response to my query and his professionalism.

It was my first visit to Austin and I had no idea of the town. But, owner’s preparation made my stay very comfortable. The house had street maps, outside security cameras, a list of event’s coming up in recent weeks, a list of things to do in Austin, washing machine, dryer, fully equipped kitchen with a coffee machine and Wifi to connect my laptop to. The owner went the extra mile by showing me around the town.

The most compelling thing for me was the location. The house is located very close to Downtown and bus stops for people like me who didn’t wanted to drive in a new country. A short cab ride took me to downtown and other restaurants.

I will be definitely staying in his house again.

The owner prepared my arrival very well, providing information and support anytime before and during my stay.

The location is great too. The house is in a residential area, very calm and pleasant, but not far from downtown, which is ideal for me.

The house has 2 bedrooms and a large living area. There is plenty of parking space (private) so the car does not have to stay on the street.

The price I paid for the stay was definitely worth it. I'll certainly book this vacation rental again for my future trips in Austin and can only recommend anybody visiting the city to do the same.

The walk to the festival was reasonable and it was far enough removed that we didn't have to deal with crazy traffic.

The lot beside the house is used for parking during the festival, but we didn't have any issues and the owner was very respectful, making sure we weren't impacted by the parking traffic.

He has a computer set up in the house with internet access and a printer, which we really appreciated. It was nice to not have to drag out our laptops while we were there for little things we wanted to look up on a computer rather than our phones.

To top it all off, Alan was super responsive when we were trying to book. I emailed him pretty late at night Texas time, maybe 11pm, and he got back to us within an hour (maybe it was even sooner).

We will definitely try to stay here again the next time we are in Austin.

Located in a leafy neighbourhood just minutes from Zilker, SoCo and downtown, this house has every amenity required for a short or long stay. You won't do better than this.

I called the owner and complemented him after we left on how thoughtfully this home has been put together: tons of soft towels, extra blankets in every bedroom, toys and books for kids, huge seating areas to accommodate all your sleepers. When you stay in multiple VRBO's these details make the difference. Sure your property can sleep 10, but can they all park? Sit at the dining room table? Fit comfortably in the living area? All drink coffee at the same time out of actual mugs? Austin is awesome, but if you are visiting you already know that. All you really need to know is that this rental is spot on and the owners are obviously proud of their product, not just cashing checks. We will be back!

It is as beautiful as it looks, very clean, quiet and serene. The decor was done with much thought and care, which adds to the serenity of the home. We were traveling with my husband's college-age daughter and it was the perfect setting to spend time together in the living/kitchen/dining area or relaxing on the back porch in the comfortable seating there--and a large fenced yard if you have children.

This home would also be ideal for a larger group that wanted a place to gather and enjoy food together. The kitchen is beautiful and well-appointed--stainless steel cookware, good knives, new dinnerware, really everything you would need if you wanted to cook or bring food in.

The area was new for us--we have stayed in South Austin on other trips--and we found it fun to explore a new area. Allandale is more suburb-y than South Austin (SoCo, Travis Heights) but it still has the Austin quirkiness we love.

We loved the all-organic breakfast and lunch spot called Pacha and hanging out at a coffee house called Genuine Joe which also features live music. There is YogaYoga nearby.

Great touch leaving some snacks and a bottle of wine for us when we arrived. Laura was easy to communicate with and gave us privacy although we were disappointed when charged more than double per person per night for extra guests, when a friend stayed overnight. When questioning the higher rate, Laura explained that apparently the prices were wrong on the website and blaimed the HomeAway app. We just felt that the excessive over charge was due to the fact that we stayed during SXSW and they could get away with charging more during this time. We were already paying premium prices raised for the SXSW time period.That was the only disappointment, other than that, the studio was very nice.

My only suggestion would be for this place to have its own ""dedicated"" wifi service versus relying on the main house service as we found the service spotty at best. Secondly, South Austin is hilly in many spots and this location in Travis Heights is one of them. Property has a very steep driveway so some vehicles may not be able to access the property. My point here is that if you have any type of mobility disability this location could be a major challenge so please keep that in mind.

We found the space fit our needs very well. The bed was comfortable and the kitchenette had enough equipment to allow for a few meals at home. Location is superb with just a 10-15 minute walk to trendy South Congress. I wouldn't hesitate to rent again!

Due to a last minute event, Laura upgraded me and my friend to her ground floor 1BR apartment and we were truly satisfied. The house was spectacular: much space, privacy and decorated with distinguished artful taste.

The neighborhood is mostly residential, with quality housing and very quiet. While you might feel you're in the middle of the hoods while resting at home, it's located quite near SoCo and downtown (around 20 min walk, if you're a fan of not using the car that much!). There's also a beautiful walk along the Colorado river which you shouldn't miss.

Last, but definitely not least: Laura was a perfect Host: personally welcomed us, had some few treats in the kitchen for us and was always available and understanding.

We definitely look forward to staying with Laura again when we return to Austin!

I found the owner to be informative and friendly as well. I love the location as it provided easy access to Lady Bird Lake as well as Congress St. Generally, downtown was close by. The apartment was well decorated and comfortable which made it very confortable. The kitchen was full size and had basic cooking equipment. The a/c was cold but didn't pump out enough air to cool the apartment thoroughly - so some nights were warm. Despite that, I was still comfortable and would definitely stay at this location again. This location also had a washer and dryer which was great! And plenty of closet for clothes and great storage space to tuck away luggage. Overall I was very pleased and I had a great stay. As I said I would definitely stay here again!!

The Travis Heights apartment met all of these standards and more!

 I cannot emphasize enough how convenient the apartment's location is. Whether you want to run along Town Lake, visit the Capitol, or explore SoCo you are only a short walk or drive away. While staying in the apartment you are near all of the action, but at the same time you are able to enjoy all of the benefits of living in a residential neighborhood. It is truly the best of both worlds.

 The apartment itself is incredibly cute and quaint. It has everything you need for a short or extended stay. Not to mention the landlords do their best to make sure you feel comfortable and safe throughout your visit! They are the best!

 Again, whether you are visiting Austin for one of its many cultural events, a job, or just for a vacation this is the ideal place to stay!

The studio/carriage apartment was a perfect place for us to crash after a long day at the race track. The location was perfect - when we didn't want to drive ourselves, we jumped on a bus that took us to downtown in just a couple of minutes, and SoCo is within a walking distance. The studio was clean and well maintained and the owner was a pleasure to deal with. The layout/amenities may not be everybody's cup of tea, but for us, it worked out perfectly.

There is no nicer home away from home , especially for those who want access to an exciting urban environment, with a rural feel. The private alley and it's position set back away from the road ensures quiet and privacy. You feel as if you are nestled in a tree with all the comforts of the modern world: wireless internet, etc. Everything worked very well and the neighborhood is friendly and clean. 10 minute walk to the fashionable South Congress strip with plenty of restaurants and stores.

The house is organized perfectly for large groups. Each bed room has multiple double beds and the large basement has an additional 7 beds (3 trundle style beds and a sleeper couch) that had more than enough room for everyone to have their own bed. The keypad entry was ideal for multiple groups coming and going from the house at different times. The three large upstairs bathrooms were great. Multiple living areas provided tons of couch space for hanging out around the house. The large kitchen was wide open and easy to clean. Large table space was available for everyone to eat together.

Robert was great with communication with anything we needed. The house had several rules regarding outside noise, which was easy to comply with given ample space inside the house.

Neighborhood was very quiet and felt safe walking around at night. Uber/Lyft to 6th/Rainey were around $5-$10 depending on availability. We also enjoyed the many food options available around East Austin.

Would highly recommend this house to anyone looking to make the most out of a trip to Austin.

I had 16 guys in Austin for a Bachelor Party and it worked out perfectly. The first floor is an open space where dining room, kitchen, and family room are all view-able from one end of the house to the other. There were four bedrooms with double/single/bunk bed combinations to maximize sleeping space. The Bathrooms were all recently upgraded and very clean. No one ever had to wait for a shower during our stay there. The Basement is no frills, but has plenty of beds to accommodate anyone that couldn't find one upstairs.

Robert was a great home owner. Very responsive whenever I had a concern or question, and extremely accommodating to our special requests.

There were a few items that weren't working in the house when we got there, but nothing that prevented us from having a great time. The house is located in an up-and-coming neighborhood, but we never felt threatened or worried during our stay. It is a few miles from most of the activity of downtown, so a car rental or dependence on Uber is a necessity. There are very tight noise restrictions outside the house due to the proximity of neighbors, but we never had a problem as long as we kept everyone inside at night.

At the end of the Day, it was a great place in a great city and I would not hesitate to book again and stay at this house.

The location was also great because it was minutes from the different downtown areas. All of our Uber rides were cheap. There was plenty of sitting areas and space for this large group. The kitchen also was spacious. Upon arrival, paper products, trash bags, kitchenware, various condiments, spices, etc. were all available for use stated by the very kind owner. The owner also was extremely responsive and quick whenever I had questions about things. He also sent my security deposit back the night I checked out.

2746,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3486281#reviews,"Jun 10, 2015",2/5,House Not What It Seems -- Beware,"I booked this property for a 4-day bachelor party. Based on the description, we were really excited about the mix of indoor and outdoor space -- especially a large balcony immediately adjacent to the living room. Upon arriving, we were very disappointed to find the owner decided to built an ugly, plywood wall completing blocking patio access and most light into the living room. Definitely did NOT look like all the beautiful pictures and posted property description (which included large patio as key feature).

House: Overall, the house is very large and well furnished with all the necessities. As you can tell by its capacity, this is really designed as a ""crash pad"" for large groups. Most of the rooms have 4+ beds and the basement has over 7 mattresses. Living room has two seating areas that can each accommodate ~10 people comfortably and stereo with aux hookup. Unfortunately, the primary living room has a wall outside the patio door that blocks most light and access to large patio (that was advertised when I originally booked).

Neighborhood: The area is primary residential and about 1 mile from Rainey St & 6th St. As we learned, this is farther than you think during hot summer. In the end, we ended up taking Ubers at night (very cheap) but took advantage of nearby stores for supplies. Plenty of street parking. The owner has a very strict noise policy (especially outside) since there are small children living next door. This policy was emphasized several times prior to check-in, although we did not encounter any issues.

I'd recommend for large groups if you plan to have a quiet gathering; however, I cannot give more than 2 stars since property was inconsistent with description and we specifically picked the unit for outside patio (next to living room). I would have expected some notice or disclosure from the owner. I hope the owner revises the description to EXCLUDE the patio and adds new photos of the living room that showcase the plywood wall by the living room. If you're okay with this ""feature"" (which was probably added to reduce outside noise), it's a great house.

Enjoy Austin!

It was my first time using HomeAway so I wasn't 100% sure what to expect. Robert was an EXCELLENT host - he was very responsive to all my questions, he responded quickly and thoroughly to every email. Robert had a wonderfully detailed list of tips, tricks and info on the property and the surrounding area that he sent over to make everything a very seamless experience. The house appears to be in a neighborhood that is in ""transition"" - there were lots of homes like this one that have been recently renovated, and others that had not been. The location was great for what we needed - we took Ubers everywhere but only had to go max 10 minutes to get pretty much everywhere we wanted to go (downtown, rainey st, etc). The house is great inside and very true to the images in the listing. The outside patio fit all 21 of us comfortably and was a really nice addition to be able to enjoy the beautiful Austin weather. The bedrooms were small with all of our luggage in them but there was plenty of bed space for all of us to sleep comfortably. The bathrooms must have been recently renovated - they were large and very new, and the showers were phenomenal. It was really perfect accommodations for such a large group - the kitchen was a great area for hanging out and conversing. Thank you to Robert for the great experience!

My only complaint, and this is kinda nitpicky here, was the toilet paper. Like less than one ply. We joked that we should save our register receipts from the weekend and use those as they'd be more effective and soft.

I have never used online home rental before, so i was VERY nervous being an out of stater and only going by reviews/pictures but trust me when i tell you all of my worries were gone the minute i stepped foot inside this beauty. It is spacious enough for big groups to hang out in the kitchen with a HUGE counter area and a wide open living room with a big screen TV, and stereo system! My favorite is the deck which is set up so appropriately for relaxing time with both couches chairs and even a bed thing for lounging. The four bedrooms are spaced out enough through out the house so that we were comfortable having our own space and the 3 bathrooms were more than enough to accommodate all of these ladies under one roof for a four day weekend. What is special about this house is that is doesn't feel like a hotel or generic property. It has a cozy feel and is decorated with unique pieces which really makes u forget you are in a vacation rental. As for as proximity to downtown and 6th st.. it is less then 10 minutes to the heart of the city and theres even taxi service numbers provided for you on the fridge! I can't say thank you enough to the owner for being so available and professional towards us! I would recommend this home to anyone going to Austin!

- the house is big and clean! Plenty of room for all of us to sleep comfortably. The 4 bedrooms have 1-2 beds in it. Plus there are pull outs in the couches, bunk beds downstairs and some extra mattresses/cots.

- living room has plenty of couches for a large or small group to lounge. A huge TV for any lazy afternoon. Plus a great sound system with a iPod plug.

- the kitchen was great! Very large and spacious with all the basic necessities. Our group made breakfast a few mornings and ate around the huge island in the middle of the kitchen.

- you would image with 13 women, bathrooms could be an issue. Not here. The house has 3 full bathrooms which worked out good for our group. Plus there is a large, full mirror in the kitchen which some of us sat on the floor and put on make up etc.

- the house is located In a quiet little neighborhood about 8-10 minutes from downtown. It's just a quick cab ride to any major hot spot (downtown, Rainey st, congress street, etc). I recommend any going to download the ""hail a cab"" app on your smartphone which helps you easily get a cab.

- the porch! The back porch was definitely one of the coolest parts of the house. It's huge with plenty of chairs to hang out.

The location was the best part of this rental. The neighborhood has an abundance of culture and most everything you need is close. With a mix of families, hipsters and Hispanics we felt like we fit in well. We liked shopping at the La Michoacana Meat Market, eating at all the food trucks (East Side King), and walking to The White Horse tavern. The lake trail is not far so we rented bikes form Longhorn Bikes and rode to Barton springs to go canoeing and to downtown.

The owner was very easy to communicative with and answered all of our questions very thoroughly. We would defiantly recommend this rental to our friends and family.

Very clean, comfortable bed, and our teenages slept fine on the futon. The owner was great and had some OJ, coffee/creamer, and some scones waiting for our arrival. Only downside was 4 females and only a single mirror in bathroom...another mirror hanging or even full length would be a nice addition outside the bathroom. Overall great place and would stay here again!

The accommodations were clean and quiet, perfect for my wife and me. Debra had the apartment spic and span upon our arrival, and was a courteous and thoughtful hostess. Everything we needed was there, and the location can't be beat. The trip downtown only took 10-15 minutes. We really enjoyed the food in Austin, too--a steakhouse one night, Texas BBQ another, and Tex-Mex a third, plus breakfast at the Quack Bakery, which is just a few blocks away from the apartment. We walked some of the trail around Lady Bird Lake one evening and ran it the next morning, spent an hour on the water in a double kayak, and had a fantastic time. If we ever have a chance to get back to Austin (and we'd love to), we would definitely hope that this studio is available then.

It was well though out and extremely clean and welcoming. The owner had even placed some bread rolls milk coffee apples etc in the fridge to get us started. This was really appreciated as we arrived after a long journey at 9pm. It is close to UT and very close to the supermarket and liquor store. Laundry facilities are well priced but take plenty of quarters for the coin op machines. We had a very comfortable stay here and would certainly return if we come back to Austin.

There was a VERY comfortable bed plenty of clean towels and Debra the delightful owner had even put in some basic groceries such as milk, bagels, coffee, apples etc to get us started. I really appreciated this on arrival and was disappointed that our apartment managers in Cleveland and Washington DC have not done the same. There is nothing better after an arduous/stressful journey than to sit down with a cup of coffee and a healthy snack before you start to unpack and get going. We were able to have breakfast the next morning then find the local shops. We chose to walk the 10 minute walk and take a taxi back which cost only about 5 dollars. The local HEB supermarket is open 24/7 and has everything you need. I will say get a load of quarters if you need to do washing/drying. 4 for a wash and 5 for a dryer. They are industrial machines and work very well. I loved this part of my holiday and the Texans are so helpful.

Then when I arrived at Austin Airpot, she had to tell me the ac in the apt was broken. But by the time I got to the apt, Debra had booked & paid for 2 nights in a hotel while the apt ac was being fixed and paid for our meals as the hotel had no kitchen . When we got to the apt Debra made sure we had all we needed there too. She's a wonderful host! The apt has easy access to 35 and a few different bus lines. I'd stay there again.

"
2790,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3489155#reviews,"Jan 8, 2018",1/5,Buyer Beware!!,"For the record, I have used various online rental websites numerous times over many years, both in the United States and abroad, and never have I even remotely incurred such an inexcusable and unprofessional experience. Without exception, all my prior experiences have been positive.

I had flown to Austin, TX for a job. The room that I planned to stay at, in no uncertain terms, had been advertised by the owner on Homeaway.com to be in the ""downtown area” and an “apartment.”

In reality, the location was a 15 minute drive from downtown (I had no car) and in the center of an industrial park, with nothing close by resembling a downtown area.

This was specifically listed as a “separate apartment.” In reality, it was actually a room off a main house, merely separated by a sheet of drywall.

When I arrived at the given address, there was a dog barking in the main house, which I immediately was concerned of disrupting my sleep.

Fortunately, my Uber driver was very concerned about leaving me at this highly suspect location, so he waited until I made sure this was the correct place.

As I opened the door to the room, I was immediately over taken by a strong, putrid stench of urine. I immediately closed and locked the door and called, texted, and emailed the owner and Homeaway.

I instructed the Uber driver to take me to the downtown area where I was able to get a safe hotel room for my stay. Immediately following, I had to rush to my job and barely arrived in time, extremely stressed and upset by the obvious deception and mischaracterizing of the Homeaway apartment. My well planned cushion of time had been completely consumed by my need to secure alternate lodging and adversely affected my job.

The owner of the “apartment” in question eventually returned my call and told me she wouldn't refund any of my money.

Since I travel quite a bit for my profession, I always read reviews before deciding on lodging. In this instance, the ""positive"" reviews that were presented on her Homeaway listing as bona fide, to induce customers (like myself) to stay at her location, were decidedly inaccurate. Needless to say, the urine stench had also not been indicated in the listing.

For me, it was an expensive lesson of grossly misplaced trust. Fortunately, Austin has an endless sea of alternative lodging available and from reputable sources.

Caveat Emptor.

It was just my husband and I and it worked great for us as we were out most of the day sightseeing and eating our way through Austin. It was very clean, quiet and we loved the location. It was close to downtown and in a quiet and safe neighborhood. Only a $10 UBER ride one-way on a Saturday night to get downtown which was cheaper and easier than parking our car down there.

The bed was comfortable and the bathroom is nice and spacious. We weren't sure about the noise machine, but ended up using it the 2nd night as we found that we don't have songbirds in Colorado like they do in Texas and they like to get up with the sun!

Carye was available and in fact, we didn't need anything from her because she is so organized with the information that we received prior to the stay and then the guidelines that she provided us once we got there. We will return when we come back to Austin. Thank you Carye!

My husband was working during the day so my child and I stayed around the room, which was comfy enough to do so, and got to venture off into town because we were a short drive away from things! I wanted to cook so, with a little creativity, I made all of our meals with the help of the small fridge/freezer and the microwave. (And I brought a crockpot from home.) The owner responded quickly when I asked a question upon arrival. I felt safe in the neighborhood and enjoyed sitting in the private space in the backyard! Other things: the closet is big enough for a packnplay, they provided two sets of silverware, 2 bowls, 2 plates, 2 wine glasses, 2 glasses, 2 mugs, bottle openers, towels, a kerig with pods, tea, and sugar/creamer!

The room was comfortable and cozy, and the bathroom was nice with the shower and tub. We went to South Congress, Downtown, and Barton Springs and the drives were pretty easy. It wouldn't be too bad if you needed to get an Uber (or whatever Austin has at the time). Carye also allowed us to check in early and leave late, which made for a much more relaxed Sunday morning.

Two things to mention: I arrived late the first night and couldn't see the house number because the lights weren't on. Might help future guests to leave the front lights on; so they can see the numbers; secondly, the TV wasn't working correctly. These both aren't big issues at all, but I wanted to make you aware.
