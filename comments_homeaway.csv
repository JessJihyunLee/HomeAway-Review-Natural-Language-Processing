0,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p1000517vb#reviews,"Jul 26, 2018",5/5,Great home for a weekend away!,"Barbara couldn't have made staying at her home any easier! The communication before and during our stay was wonderful and then the home itself turned out to be even better than it looked in photos! The home is spacious and cozy with a great backyard and pool which we definitely took advantage of. The home is very close to a grocery store as well. Overall, I would happily recommend this spot to any groups of travelers looking for a quiet cozy place to spend a vacation.

1,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p1000517vb#reviews,"Jan 15, 2018",5/5,Colorful and clean house perfect for a group of four,"We were four co-workers traveling to Austin for a week on a business trip.

Location : One of the key deciding factors for us was the place need to be within 10 minutes from Domain. Drive from this house to Domain was predictable 10 minute through out the week, which was awesome. HEB and several stores are within few minutes drive, which makes it convenient for quick grocery run.

House : Pictures represent the house very accurately. No surprises, which is a big deal in vacation rentals. Colorful and clean house and has all the amenities described in the listing. There is a small deck on the tree (yes built on the tree trunk), which is missing in the pictures and description. Kids would love this. Kitchen was small but very functional and had all type of utensils and basic seasoning. Two rooms had their own bathrooms and the other two rooms had to share one bathroom. Swimming pool looked great but we didn't venture out in the cold. Hot tub was great and was perfect for chilly evenings. Functional gas grill would excite every type of traveler.

Checkin/Checkout : Booking confirmation email had all the details regarding check-in and check-out process and it was a breeze to enter the place.

Host: Barbara was a fantastic host and was regularly checking to see if our stay was coming along as expected. We requested her for a mid week house cleaning, which was clearly not part of the agreement. She went above and beyond to make it happen without any additional cost. This is not common for rentals less than a week. We appreciate the gesture.

Overall, we highly recommend this place and would love for the opportunity to come back and stay here.

2,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p1004864vb#reviews,"Apr 29, 2018",5/5,Incredible Experience,"We had an amazing time staying at Dan's beautiful home. A few friends and I were in Austin for the weekend and his house made the trip. The backyard/pool area is incredible. The interior is modern and perfectly decorated. We'll certainly be back. Highly recommended.

"
3,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p1004864vb#reviews,"Mar 27, 2018",5/5,"Great Looking, Modern House in Awesome Zilker Neighborhood","Had a great experience staying in Zilker at Dan's house, top-notch hospitality all around. The house was in beautiful condition and was the perfect place for our visit to Austin. Awesome outdoor amenities, pool, hot tub, ping-pong, spacious bedrooms and a beautiful enormous (80"") flat-screen for the couple of down moments we did enjoy. The house is only a couple of blocks from S Lamar and many great restaurants, coffee shops etc. Our host Dan was incredibly generous and responsive, also very detailed with all the necessary information to properly enjoy the house and surrounding neighborhood. Would highly recommend this for anyone visiting Austin. Can't wait to go back!

"
5,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p1006015vb#reviews,"Aug 13, 2018",4/5,The Catherine,"Stayed in Unit 1710 at the Cathrine. Accomendations were great. Good location...5 minute ride to Downtown Austin.

The condo was very clean and nicely furnished. Don't plan to cook there though, limited plates etc. And the sink in the master bedroom took forever to go down. Outside of that, a great place to stay and I would go back again if I revisit Austin.

"
7,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p1006015vb#reviews,"May 29, 2018",5/5,"Perfect location, beautiful apartment","We loved our stay at the Lux Haus. The apartment was beautiful with views of the riverside. It was the absolute perfect location for us - in the heart of the downtown area, walking distance to all race activities. Check-in and check-out were super easy. Beds were comfortable, the place was spacious, gorgeous and clean. Our only wish was that there were more kitchen supplies (dishwasher soap, a cutting board, a few more knives, etc.). But we made do!

"
8,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p1006015vb#reviews,"May 16, 2018",5/5,Excellent and All That We Hopes for . . .,"Lovely setting. Great views. Easy access to many Austin attractions, including 2nd St and Congress Ave. really cozy and comfy beds. Very clean. Airy and light, with great views and lovely balconies.

"
9,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p1006015vb#reviews,"May 3, 2018",4/5,Great Condo,"My two children and I stayed for 3 nights and had a great time in this condo. The residents are very friendly, the pool was great and the grill was very awesome to cookout on. The only negative is there is not many pots or cooking supplies in the kitchen. We would stay here again in a heartbeat!

Apartment should have been a bit cleaner as well. I wiped the counter down with Clorox and my cloth was dirty....not a great start to a vacation.

"
12,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p1006015vb#reviews,"Apr 7, 2018",5/5,Great apartment .,"Very well situated building with all modern amenities, great location- close to the park, restaurants and markets.

Apartment is clean, comfortable for family of 4. I would stay in the apartment again and would recommend without any hesitation.

"
13,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p1006015vb#reviews,"Feb 25, 2018",3/5,Clean but lacking,"The master bed is very soft and not supportive. If you’re used to a supportive mattress this won’t be comfortable for you.

The kitchen is not well stocked. Minimal supplies- the reason we rent condos on vacation is so that we can do some cooking rather than eating out all of the time. It only had one frying pan (which was dirty before I used it the first time) and minimal cooking utensils. No cheese grater, bad knives, tiny coffee cups, etc. If you plan to eat every meal out this will be fine for you.

Also the unit is a corner unit which is nice but it is right next to the trash chute which is very noisy in the mornings as people are taking out their trash. Overall it wasn’t too loud but the trash chute was a little annoying.

"
14,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p1006015vb#reviews,"Feb 7, 2018",5/5,Amazing view! Amazing accommodations!,"Perfect place to stay in downtown Austin area. The view is worth every penny alone, but the accommodations are more than satisfying, as well.

"
15,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p1006015vb#reviews,"Jan 29, 2018",5/5,Amazing place in a great location,"I was very happy with the place. Nicely set up, new, luxurious, comfortable, great facilities, good location, etc. I'll certainly book this again when I'm in Austin next time.

"
16,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p1006015vb#reviews,"Nov 16, 2017",5/5,"Comfy, Cozy, Incredible view!","We loved our stay in the Lux Haus unit 1710. Security in the building was great, and the lobby area was gorgeous and free daily gourmet coffee and ice if needed :). The bedrooms are spacious and the baths and amenities are very nice... tons of closet space, 2 balcony views, can see Colorado River near Congress Bridge. Great Location for downtown and Zilker Park and riverwalks. I would love to stay here again. And the owner is easily accessible and quick to respond to needs.

"
17,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p1006015vb#reviews,"Aug 14, 2017",5/5,Great location,"Enjoyed three nights here with my family. Very much enjoyed it. Great location to all the activities on South Congress as well as easy to get downtown. Walking distance to the Bats, Yeti store, etc. Kids like the building pool, and we also went to the top floor terrace to view the sunset (called the penthouse).

Beautiful, central location.","The place has everything you need. Except a broom. Nobody wants to clean or sweep while on vacation but we were there for 6 days and the beautiful dark wood floors needed a sweep. Other than that great location. Great buolding/pool/lounge/gym. Our stay was fantastic.

"
21,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p1006015vb#reviews,"Apr 17, 2017",4/5,Outstanding Austin location convenient to all that is hip and happening,"Nice and comfortable 2 bedroom unit with great balconies and comanding views of Austin. Conveniently located so you can comfortably walk to Austin's attractions, restaurants and parks. Great pool and outdoor cooking area to support any desire to entertain while you are visiting. We had 4 adults staying and entertained a total party of 7 over the Easter weekend. Being a relatively new unit in the rental rotation, I make the following comments that could enhance the overall experience: (1) Assure that there are enough glasses and plates to accomodate residents and guests, (2) it would be helpful if the unit had a stock of paper towels, (3) assure TVs in all rooms are properly functioning before guest arrival, (4) consider an higher quality mattress choice for the master bedroom and (5) install some outdoor seating to more thoroughly enjoy the unit's balconies. All said, it was an great experience and we would recommend the property for guests visiting Austin looking for an alternative to the areas hotels.

"
22,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p1006016vb#reviews,"Sep 16, 2018",5/5,Beautiful! A perfect weekend getaway.,"This weekend was above and beyond my wildest expectations. The minute I opened the door, I knew it was going to be a great time. It was my turn to host our Reunion Weekend. The apartment is spacious, clean, and has a breathtaking view of downtown Austin. Whether we were sipping coffee on the balcony in the morning, having a cocktail at the Sky Bar, or just relaxing in the living room looking at the skyline....it was fantastic. The Catherine is walking distance to restaurants, hiking and biking paths, kayak rentals, and a grocery store is only a few blocks away. Definitely looking forward to returning.

The beds were super comfortable. Beautiful views of the city. Close to downtown. Great communication with the property manager. The only complaint I had, for a gourmet kitchen, there's hardly any kitchen tools/supplies (I couldn't even find a cutting board!). Other than that, the place is perfect. I will definitely stay at The Lux again.

"
32,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p1006016vb#reviews,"May 22, 2018",5/5,Perfectplace,"Our trip was made that much better by our stay. The condo was a perfect fit for our family, the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms and the spacious living room - kitchen space. Not to mention the location, close to all of Austin’s hotspots!

I do have a few observations that in no way had any negative impact on our stay, however you should know that the coffee table wheels are loose and I believe even missing some bolts. Also seeing that there is room for at least 6 adults more glasses would have been helpful and perhaps there should be a review of what items are in the kitchen. Lastly, they only left us one extra trash bag, we could have used 1 or 2 more. Again none of this had any real impact but I thought I would mention it.

The pool was excellent. The rooftop lounge was great.

Again Perfect Place For Us

The location was fantastic and close to everything. A couple things of note. I had a hard time parking because the spaces are not labeled well and there are no lines. The couch is showing a lot of wear and the apartment is in need of some trim, caulk and paint work. The pillows are too soft for my liking.

Reviewer Comments:

Apartment location is great: walked next door to Z'Tejas for dinner, easy walk to lake for early morning runs, able to stop back on way to apartment for coffee and muffins at Whole Foods, walked to buy cd's at Waterloo, walked to lunch at The Grove. When we couldn't walk we planned our activities carefully so we weren't trying to cross lake wrong way during rush hour, but managed that just fine. Easy drives to both Barton Springs and Deep Eddy for swimming and to both Uchi and Odd Duck on S. Lamar, and Vespaio on S. Congress for dinner. Beyond its location, the apartment itself was very comfortable and clean. Love how it is nestled into the hillside and trees. Management was very responsive to the only concern I had (couldn't initially connect to WiFi). Bed was comfortable and all appliances in good working order (and better than what we have at home). Highly recommended.

Good: The condo had a great location, was very spacious and the kitchen provided some nice amenities.

We just returned from a six day stay at this property. It is in an absolute perfect location, far enough away from noise that can be Austin's 6th Street, but still close to the action. Overall it is a good property, but we did have a few issues. The kitchen is lacking some very rudimentary supplies. There is not pitcher, and when I called to ask about one, I was told it was not standard. When I then discovered that there was not a spatula, I did not even bother contacted the property management. When we originally checked in everything seemed to be very clean. However, that was at night, and when I saw the shower in daylight it definitely could have used a more thorough cleaning. The showerhead was also problematic because it was difficult to get it too stay in one place and at a position that would prevent water from leaking out onto the floor. The pillows in the master where very flimsy and provided no support. All of these issues are things that can be easily corrected and if they are then it will be a five star property.

It's a 45min walk to get to the other side of the river. The interior is unique. The property is located in a sort of ""compound"" with stone walls around. The AC units are not enough to cope with the Texas heat. They have to run constantly to keep 76deg. That and the trains passing close at night is probably why they provide ear plugs at the bedside. I had to use the shower to clean the filter screen on the bedroom AC unit, it looked like it hadn't been rinsed in a year. Laundry on site is a nice perk. The donkeys on the property are cute and unique. A few dead cockroaches found around, but sort of expected in a ground floor older place in central Texas. The management company leaves a lot to be desired. They inundate you with automated emails, pretending to be personalized and responsive. I didn't realize how far this was from town, and asked to be moved to one of their other properties. Was told that wasn't an option. Ok, fine. Then afterward I get mixed signals about whether they found an item I left. An email hinted at that, and of course they didn't respond to any of my inquiries via email. Called and they said asked a whole bunch of irrelevant questions then says ""We've located an item that matches your description"" then asks, ""which part of the house did you leave it in""? What? Did you find it or not? You have my mailing address and everything via email already. They asked me if I wanted expedited processing for an additional fee. It seems getting an expedient answer about whether an item is found is expedited service. Finally they confirmed they will mail it. It's been 20 days since I inquired. What a chore. What a sloppy operation. I should have stayed at a hotel.

I don't normally leave reviews, but breaking my tradition here. Beautiful place to stay. Like a small compound, under beautiful big trees and native plants, and a pair of donkeys to talk to. Now for the downside, train tracks back the property about 200 ft away, so bring some earplugs to help you sleep through the night. My biggest issues were with TURNKEY VACATION RENTALS. We arrived after our check-in time, and the door code didn't work, so I had to call them and wait for them to reset the new door code. Light bulb was out on the stove top (which we replaced), there was a long black hair left in the shower floor by the cleaning service TURNKEY uses, and they left only 1 bath towel for 2 of us staying multiple days. After calling again, TURNKEY took care of it and credited me back $25 for the inconvenience. They graciously extended our last day check out time to noon, however the door code reset around 10am and we were unable to come and go, and had to leave the unit unlocked upon departure. After having to pay a $50 non-refundable damage fee, and a $110 ""Professional"" cleaning fee, and a $46 booking service fee, I've learned my lesson, I will avoid rental properties that are managed by TURNKEY.

This location was everything the advertisement said. We wanted to be near the city, but get that country vibe and the Casita provided that.

Arrived late on the Friday to the apartment lit up and cold drinks in the fridge. We went for a wander and found somewhere nearby to get some essentials (cider and crisps) and Thai takeout to bring back.

There was everything we could possibly have needed for our stay, microwave, grill, kettle and coffee machine with a selection of fresh coffee to use. Hairdryers, towels and toiletries also available.

Having used this as our base for the USGP it was a perfect location to wander into Austin downtown and only 20 mins or so to COTA

Having spent our first full day at COTA I asked whether the host had a outdoor blanket or camping chairs we could borrow for the next day and she was happy to leave out 3 comfortable camping chairs for us to use.....very genourous and very much appreciated.

I would definitely return to the apartment and Austin. It has a relaxed friendly feel with so many places to eat nearby and Julie and her husband made us feel so very welcome.

The location is absolutely perfect and a 15 minute walk to the popular music venues in the downtown area and it reminds me on a small town nestled in a sprawling city. I highly recommend going to the Texas State Cemetery which is literally two blocks away. Julia is a great host with a wealth of knowledge of go-to spots and she’s more than willing to point in the right direction.

As a previous guest mentioned, there is a lot of noise from the upstairs with foot traffic and dogs barking in the early hours of the morning. This is my only complaint and not a huge one as everything was beautiful and only a minor inconvience in the grand scheme of things. For me, it was a bit loud given a festival I was attending ran very late and I would easily stay here again if I were coming to town with a more mellow, restful schedule.

The place was very clean, the bed comfortable, and I had no noise issues whatsoever, whether from the house upstairs or the surrounding neighbourhood.

Julie was considerate, thought through all aspects of our stay and made herself available for any questions. It was a very short walk to popular areas and great to come home to a quiet neighborhood. The apartment had everything that was needed, including a small refrigerator! The only things to consider when booking are that it is a basement apartment so you will hear the occasional shuffle of movement upstairs and we had some unexpected multi-legged visitors (roly poly bugs & some other bug friends) we had to put back in the yard.

We stayed here the night before our band played its sold out show in a very well-attended SXSW showcase. We were worried about getting enough rest on the road so we decided to rent a quiet place to get some sleep. This place was perfect; the walls were thick and it's very secluded for how close it is to everything (it's literally a few blocks from 35 aka walking distance to downtown.)

The backyard was pretty spacious and they've got a nice fire pit you can sit around, the whole thing is very chill actually. I'd recommend it to pretty much anyone. It's pretty affordable so you don't have to be a millionaire or rock star in our case to rent it out. Julie and Francois are very chill people, not sure if they always hang out with everyone but we spent a lot of time talking and getting to know each other. Really glad we got lucky and came through town on a night it was open. 10/10, definitely recommend staying here if you can get a spot.

All the kitchen appliances you could need and a full complement of pots, pans, and dishes. Made a run to Wal-Mart for groceries and saved a lot of money cooking breakfasts and light lunches for my large family. Three bedrooms with COMFORTABLE queen size pillow top mattresses. Tons of closet space. Another bedroom has a click-clack sofa that also makes a bed, and there is a computer desk there, too. There is also a separate washroom with a very adequate washer, dryer, and ironing board. Free wi-fi.

This property is close to Airport Blvd, which makes getting around Austin easy. The driveway circles around the house, so you can park multiple cars with no issues at all.

To start, the house was everything it was made out to be. Our whole group of 14 slept comfortably and had no trouble with sharing one bathroom. The place was also in great shape upon our arrival, very well cleaned. Then you step outside and immediately fall in love with view of Lake Travis. There is an awesome beach set-up with a fire place, and it's probably the best spot in all of Austin to watch the sunset. On top of the breathtaking view, the place also had a ton of fun things to do: kayaks, a ping pong table, a foosball table, cornhole boards, and much more!

The owner, Jeff, is also great. He's a very laid back guy, and encourages guests to have the most fun they possibly can during their stay at Tres Aguas. If we had any questions or needed anything, Jeff was very willing to help.

All in all, there is no doubt I will be staying at Tres Aguas again.

Most of our time was spent around the fire pit on the private beach landing right on the water. We enjoyed the kayaks and the hot tub on the back deck. The location is fantastic as well close to breweries and great restaurants. It’s also a short drive to Austin proper.

Being outdoors during spring break was fabulous. We did some kayaking, hammock lazing, fire pit chilling, hot tubbing and outdoor grilling. People loved coming over to spend a few hours with us in the evenings; come here for the views and the privacy.

The house I would give 3 star. There really is only 2 bedrooms rather than the advertised 3 (the 3rd bedroom is a den we were unable to curtain off).

There is a good Randells grocery store about 0.5 miles away, so we could easily remedy what we were missing and the owners were happy to bring things to us if needed.

So very close to a 5 star except for those few items around the house. We would come back again.

Suggestions for an improved guest experience would be to ensure there are enough adult life jackets for the kayaks on-prem, include information about how to reset the breakers for the hot water in the information packet, how to turn off the outside lights, provide a recycling container for the inside (or close to the house), provide tools for the fire pit along with some fire starters and/or kindling (or mention to guests to bring their own).

The master bedroom is very spacious and comfortable with big windows that make a lot of difference. The TV has a Roku setup with most streaming options already set up. The patio and upper deck were both great spaces which I couldn't enjoy much due to the rain.

Located on a quiet street but still close enough to the downtown area and lots of restaurants.

There were a couple of minor issues - the bed in the 2nd bedroom is just enough for one person and can not fit two. I feel like the description should mention that. Also, the blinds in the 2nd bedroom let in a LOT of light and it would be nice if they could be changed.

Regarding Turnkey - this is the third time I'm booking a Turnkey property and the second time the door code has stopped working in the middle of my stay. Of course their helpline staff is available to generate a new door code, but its still annoying to have to go through the process - especially when it's raining outside!

The kitchen modern and well equipped, the king bed heavenly and the master bedroom dark and quiet. The second bedroom needs a queen bed, better storage, but perfect for one person. The downstairs patio cool and comfortable for coffee in the morning as is the giant kitchen island. Turnkey management was quick to fix a few small things even on the weekend.

The general amenities were a little limited. Kitchen cooking utensils were pretty light and there wasn’t any salt and pepper, a colander, or new sponges. We had to use an old sponge which was a little yucky. The big plates also didn’t fit in the dishwasher. We wished there was a queen size bed in the spare bedroom as a double is pretty small for adults or older kids. These were all very small things we thought could be improved but the place was clean, very nice and in a great location. It’s an adorable condo near everything and we absolutely loved being so close to Zilker Park for morning runs.

I was in town on business and it was my first time being in a vacation rental instead of a hotel. I had an amazing experience. The home was in a beautiful neighborhood near a park and a very cool sculpture museum. The decor was exactly as it appeared on-line and was super clean. It was nice being able to have a study group over to prepare for a big work event and dine in. The only thing I could have wanted more was someone to share this beautiful property with. I found myself on the deck or the back porch often. I would absolutely rent this again for another business trip or a great week visit or weekend in Austin.

The only thing I would change would be the blinds in the second bedroom - they are very sheer and not great for privacy or morning sleeping.

The property is very nice and well equipped. Beds are comfortable and there were basic kitchen/bathroom essentials available. It's a good location in Austin. There is a lot of technology in this home (TV, blinds, HVAC, lights, etc.) but minimal instructions on how to use them. It would be nice to have a cheat sheet upon arrival. During our stay, the heater was not working and it was an unusually cold spell in Austin. The property management was very prompt, but unfortunately due to the holiday weekend, the heater could not be repaired during our stay. They tried to accommodate and offered a discount on our stay.

we stayed in the townhouse with 2 young children for 10 days. the location is very convenient, close to bilker park which is perfect for kids. close to restaurants in S. Lamar and Barton Springs road. the house has a fully equipped kitchen so we could cook every day. We'd happily stay there again.

174,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p1051964vb#reviews,"Jul 3, 2017",4/5,Great location,"This property was a great location for our visit in the Austin area. Most of the touristy things to do in the area were all 15 minutes or less driving time. The neighborhood was safe and friendly, and quiet most of the time (Construction next door was loud at times ). Nice deck on top for drinks at night. The staff at Turn Key was very helpful and polite. Master bed was very comfortable.

Why I didn't give a 5 star rating:

- Only futon in 2nd bedroom instead of regular mattress. Queen bed would be a good investment.

-While they brought some promptly after I called, there initially were no mixing bowls and only 3 clothes hangers in the unit.

- There is a nice patio area in the back but no landscaping, just scrubby grass and dirt to look at.

- They advertised an outdoor grill that was available on the Home Away listing when we booked as well as when we arrived. After we called, they said there was not one available. We booked this listing hoping there would be one to use. However, they did credit our account for the error.

-Kitchen was missing some essentials like salt and pepper, oil, dish cloth/ sponge for wiping down counters.

Overall we had a wonderful time in the Austin area and this was a nice property to stay in!

177,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p1051964vb#reviews,"Apr 28, 2017",4/5,Perfect condo for 2 couples weekend trip,"The condo was clean, decorated nicely, very nice layout. It was perfect for the weekend trip and we probably would stay there again. It was right up the hill from some great restaurants and a food truck park! Also walking distance to Barton Springs and a quick drive to anything else. I love the neighborhood!

The back and from porches were great for relaxing, taking in the view and enjoying company. The drive into the city was easy, minus traffic. we drove a couple times, other times we used Ride Austin, which we only waited about 5 min for a pickup each time, so that's a plus.

The master bedroom was spacious, same with bathroom and closet. It's great that the second bedroom has their own full bathroom as well, though not as big.

I could definitely cook in that kitchen! Great space and had all the appliances and equipment basics. It was however missing all essentials like salt, pepper, olive oil, which sometimes places like these leave around. So bring your own if you plan on cooking and don't want to stock someone else's place.

It did have a fenced in back yard, which would be nice for kids or small dogs that need to stretch outside.

My only complaint ... the second bedroom has a futon for a bed, not an actual bed. The futon is not big enough for 2 adults (barely one tall adult) and was not comfortable. I suggest investing in a real Queen sized bed.

As a side note to the owners. There were a few items that we wanted to let you know about. We would recommend you stock more towels so your guests do not have to wash multiple loads. There were only 5 towels and 1 wash cloth. The ice maker didn’t work and there were only 3 rolls of toilet paper.

Whether you're cooking, playing pool, watching tv, or hanging by the pool, you can see the lake and fully enjoy the beauty of Lake Travis.

Shawn’s co host, Scott, checked us in, showed us around the house and answered all of our questions-- we felt immediately at home. We hired Scott to take us out on the boat and had a blast. He was a great guide and even helped us learn to water ski. It was really nice to leave the driving to an expert.

The house is beautifully decorated and very comfortable. We cooked one night and had everything we needed in the kitchen.

The pool is amazing, and we really enjoyed the built in sound system (Sonos). You can connect through your phone and control the music in different rooms (including the outside patio/pool area).

The location was also very convenient and easy to get to, and it was close to some of the best restaurants. Also, the house is close enough to the Oasis that you can drive over around 6 and put your name on the list, and come back and hang out before your table is called.

I use alot of short term rentals, and have a good reference for the following comments. I was disappointed by the number of maintenance problems with this unit. Here is a list....

1. Refrigerator door handle broken

2. No water supply for ice maker

3. Microwave lights above range out

4. Track lights in kitchen out

5. Bathroom has NO towel racks

6. Bathroom sink stopped up

7. Shower light out

8. Sonos system not working

9. Most of all, the bed foundation fell apart both nights we stayed. The cardboard, broom handle, and magazines stuffed in the slats indicate this has existed for some time. Both nights I had to spend 30 minutes reassembling the foundation just so we could go back to bed. I requested a response from the owner on these issues before I posted this review, but never heard back. As I said it is a beautiful condo, very safe, parking included, and in a great location.

We wanted a place to celebrate my dad's bday and get away that could accommodate the 9 of us. We have more than enough room. The best part is the chef like kitchen and open area where we could watch the kids swim/jump/swing/ and make memories. This place is like being at the Ritz but with space!! In addition to the gorgeous home we were able to enjoy parks, trails, and the lake right out the front door. The best part is the master bedroom is a retreat itself. We enjoyed sipping wine in room or on the private patio. Truly a wonderful weekend and I would stay again!

We had trouble connecting to the home audio system and figuring out how to work the TVs, but eventually figured it out. If you are familiar with Apple you should have no problem. The house is spacious and equipped with everything you need. We loved the pool and patio area, which we spent most of our time there. The jacuzzi was relaxing and you are able to set the temperature if you don't like it too hot. The master bedroom was comfortable and equipped with supplies. The upstairs rooms had a couple of twin beds which the kids used. The house is equipped with airbeds and extra bedding if needed. The guest room is adjacent to the game room which is spacious and inviting. We didn't really use the game room but played on the hockey table. Overall, it was a great stay. The only reason that I didn't give it five stars was that we were looking for a home close to a lake to swim, but the lake that is nearby is mainly for boat use and the swimming area is small and unclean. Therefore, we chose to head back to the property. I did look up another nearby lake such as Lake Travis which is about a 19-minute drive from the property. The other con was the check out time was early at 10 am. A later time would have been nice. Otherwise, the home was a nice, spacious, and comfortable home equipped with everything you need. We enjoyed our stay!

The home itself has a great setup with a fabulous kitchen and multiple outdoor seating areas including a 3rd story up top deck. Open and bright and nicely decorated with an ""Austin"" vibe. It could not have been more perfect. Owner was super responsive to all communications. Perfect place for our girls weekend - close enough to the action, but nice to come back to a lovely quiet space for visiting and to each have our own bed/bath. Hope to stay again some day.

Every room is meticulously designed, truly a model home. We loved all the details, the artwork, the music memorabilia, and the modern Texas aesthetic. Everyone raved at how comfortable the beds were as well. Bedrooms and bathrooms were spacious -- having 3.5 bathrooms in a 3 bed house was definitely a big plus. We had 6 people in our group and everyone had more than enough space throughout the house. We were bummed we ran out of time to use the rooftop firepit - it looked lovely (but there are just so many things to do in Austin!). Beautiful home, upscale appliances, and a perfect layout for anyone looking for a clean, comfortable, and luxurious stay in Austin.

Brian was just a text away anytime we had a question - and he was extremely responsive to anything we needed. Wifi was easy to set up, Sonos is wired throughout the first floor and super easy to connect to.

The home is beautifully decorated, clean, quiet, spacious, and the location couldn't be better - within walking distance to Zilker Park. The rooftop lounge area and fire pit were the icing on the cake, absolutely perfect for relaxation and conversation!

The host provided a very comfortable air mattress to accommodate the fifth member of our group. The only inconvenience we had was entering the home itself upon arrival (it would have been great to have detailed instructions for how to access the key via the lockbox), but this is a simple fix and everything else was just perfect!

I highly recommend this gorgeous home! A modern and cozy gem in a quintessentially-Austin neighborhood.

My husband appreciated the local whole bean coffee provided for us and I appreciated that the kitchen was furnished with basic condiments for cooking and there was cold filtered Brita water in the fridge. My kids appreciated the Netflix on the TV. David was very attentive. A pack and play was provided for us. The internet stopped working once and David responded quickly to my text and it was fixed immediately. The location is great, and it is walking distance to some great restaurants including Torchy’s Tacos and a group of food trucks. There is a nice screened in back patio where we had dinner.

It is a new listing and we were a little nervous without having the reviews since we have spent a number of prior Thanksgivings in Austin since we have a student at UT and we go to the football game. But my wife found the listing which is close to the house our son rents and once we got there we realized how many attractions were just a short drive away. Zilker park, Mount Bonnell, 6th street, south congress all are close. If you use Uber you don't even have to drive.

Modern 3 bedrooms with master down and two bedrooms up. All had ceiling fans. Owners live in the home in front and were quick to get us a few items that needed replacing. For our next trip back we hope this place is available.

I almost don't want to add this but I would be remise if I didn't mention it. When you back out of the driveway be careful of the tree. I suspect the city of Austin wouldn't let the owners cut it down.

Closet is large, bathroom has great lighting.

The location is great-if you're up for a walk you can walk down 6th street and get to most things central (capitol building, 6th street bars--the dueling pianos was a great stop!!) and Megan made some good recommendations in her booklet for nearby eats. I would also advise the Detours City Highlights Tour to get the lay of the land--it was helpful in deciding what to do. Right close to the house is the Whole Foods home which is really something to behold!

We had a wonderful stay and felt very safe--would recommend this to couples looking for a weekend retreat.

Thee online pictures of this house are great and location is great but what you get when you arrive is certainly not that. In fact the ad has misrepresentations of the house. We arrived on a Thursday, and we were denied an early check-in (and a late check-out !). We just assumed it was because the place was rented consistently. However, when we arrived the house was hot, had a musty smell like it had been closed up. Cleanliness: The floors and the kitchen counter were extremely dirty. We actually had to clean the counters and mop the floors ourselves. We were promised a refund for the cleaning fee, but I don&#x2019;t even get a reply to my communications with Turnkey. AC: The master bedroom would not cool down and we determined that the batteries in thermostat were almost dead. Until we figured this out and took batteries out of the remote, it was over 80 degrees. Eventually, the whole house cooled down, but not without some effort on our part that could have been dealt with by the rental company. Hazardous conditions: There was at least one damaged floor board in the living room which was a hazard to anyone walking without shoes. We had to move furniture to cover the board so we could let the kids walk around. Misrepresentation of property: Finally, listing had incorrect information. The only reason we rented this particular property is because we thought the 2nd and 3rd bedrooms had queen beds, because full beds are pretty uncomfortable for 2 adults. They turned out to be fully resulting in pretty uncomfortable sleeping arrangements. The incorrect listing was validated by the maintenance guy who came to look at the AC. The wifi network and password wasn&#x2019;t correct in our instructions, and we had to call to get details. -The walkway was covered by overgrown plant making it difficult to get inside with our luggage without going through the grass. - tv didn&#x2019;t functio

This is a beautiful home in a prime neighborhood. Everything about it is wonderful - I would rent it again if a few things were fixed. 1) The air conditioner and heater in the old house did not work. There is a sign on it that says ""Do not touch"" but who can resist when you are freezing from the AC and there is no heat? 2) There were rats running out in the evening and back in the morning. 3) Know that the sink in the bath of the old part of the house is tiny. The new part of the house is beautiful. The house is beautiful! Just a couple of fixable problems.

Let me start by saying the rental was in a pretty good location. Being able to walk to Central Market was nice and Central Market by the way is amazing! The rental was clean, however, there were a couple issues. First off there is definitely a roach problem as other reviewers have mentioned. Each time in the reviews the rental company says they will take care of it but obviously they don’t because it’s a consistent problem with most other renters. That was the small issue. The major issue was the horrible smell in the master bedroom coming from the carpets. When I say horrible I’m not exaggerating. I don’t understand how they can rent this place in that condition. The carpets need to be changed. I’m not a complainer and this is the first time I have ever left a bad review but I wouldn’t want someone to rent it after us not knowing this problem. I did speak with someone from Turnkey about the issue. They offered to come spray something on the carpets but I knew that trying to mask the odor could potentially make the smell worse. It’s beyond a cleaning issue. The carpets need to be ripped out. So for that reason I would not recommend this house. We were very disappointed.

An awesome location, in a house that the owner clearly takes pride in. A really great house that provided quality workout tools, kitchen equipment, and laundry machines. This place would've been a HUGE win if the hot tub would've been clean. We were in town to work a conference for 5 days and the main attraction to us was being able to relax the hot tub after each day of work. Honestly it's why we chose the property in the first place. Unfortunately upon arrival and looking in to the hot tub, it clearly had not been scrubbed in a while and had some residue floating on the top. After contacting the property manager they had the pool cleaner stop while we were at the show to inspect and clean. After returning back from the show you could smell the chlorine from the living room so someone had stopped by to clean. Unfortunately they only dumped chlorine in the tub without any attempt at removing 'the nasty'. We were hoping that the pool man would've solved the issue but it only made it more unusable now that water was chlorine 'abundant' to say the lease. Would 100% recommend staying here after they figure out the issue with the tub. Also as the other reviews have stated, if you have a phobia of cockroaches I do not recommend staying here.

Read some reviews here regarding the coachroach pest situation and thought it would’ve been taken care of. Definitely wrong... the property definitely has something that kills them because most of them were on their backs twitching. They’re most active at dawn.... so definitely turn or leave the lights on when going to the bathroom.

I had a severe reaction laying in the master bed... I only get something similar if there’s cat hair. Not sure if it was cat but some kind of fur. Couldn’t necessary see the fur but I ended up sleeping on the couch.

Overall, the house would’ve been good if it wasn’t for these two things. They remodeled the bathroom and had a washer and dryer. The layout of the house was pretty open, then there’s also a jacuzzi in the back. The fireplace in the living/family room was not working.

All in all, I’ll be renting elsewhere and not try my luck on the pests clearing. Bummer.

No, didn’t contact property management, seems like from the previous post, they didn’t address it until after checkout. I had a busy schedule so I just dealt with it. Hope this review will help others decide!

The house is fantastic, in a really cute neighborhood and with a great back yard. Super convenient to enter the house through the lock pad. Proximity to Central Market and the highway was amazing! The bonus room at the back of the house was great for the kids to run around. My only complaint is that the house has a pest problem... There were sugar ants and cockroaches in the house and the dog found a rat outside. We are not squeamish people, and just cleaned up/dealt with the pests as we found them. I contacted the management company and got one call back, but we were busy visiting family and going about our itinerary for our trip. They did not put in the effort to schedule/ send out someone to take care of the problem. We ultimately left the house a day early, which was unfortunate.

We spent the weekend with our adult children and had a great weekend. The recently remodeled house was great which included kitchen, bathrooms and enclosed back porch and deck. Property management company was a plus, house in good shape. Had one issue that can easily be resolved, an exterminator is needed to address the pests. This included roaches and ants, not a major issue but the ants did get into a decorated cake even though it was in an enclosed container. Based on the rest of our experience I am confident this minor issue will be addressed. Quiet neighborhood as well.

The towels were so fluffy and soft and the pillows were super plump! We spent a lot of time exploring hill country so we didn't spend an awful lot of time in the apartment except in the evenings, but it's fully stocked with everything you would need. If you are traveling with small children, they even though enough to include a plastic set of dishes for a small child as well as a high chair and potty chair. I was super impressed that they even included “play” towels sin addition to the bath towels. The washer and dryer being in the apartment was super convenient! The decor was great. The apartment complex is quiet, gated and secure and was beautiful! The 3 pools were amazing and the courtyard is very relaxing with the sounds of the water and all of the sitting areas and even included grills to cookout on! The amenities of the complex are endless! The door code for the apartment made getting in and out super easy! Candice was super awesome and very responsive, she even mailed an item I left in the apartment back to me! So much better than staying in a hotel and way cheaper. Best vacation accommodations to date!

We would have loved to use them, but Austin weather didn't cooperate. So we stayed inside - watched the Olympics, cooked meals, played cards. The friend we were visiting had arranged ""in home"" massages for us and the master suite couldn't have been a better ""zen"" location. Super comfortable beds. Great location with easy access to both the airport and downtown. Stacey was great to work with - easy to reach and lovely to talk to.

Easy walking distance to West Lynn restaurants and creek paths. Great deck outside for hanging out. The place is not quite fully dialed though. There were not enough plates, utensils, glasses, etc. for more than one meal at a time, so we needed to run the dishwasher several times during our stay. The dishwasher door wouldn't open all the way because of the refrigerator in place, which made it challenging to fill and empty. Also, the thermostat seemed to automatically adjust up in the middle of the night so it was pretty hot sleeping conditions. Lastly, no lamps in any bedrooms - just bright overhead lights (not very relaxing at the end of the day).

Super convenient, plenty of parking either on the street or the driveway. Helpful check-in info prior to arrival, including photos of the house and driveway. The house is a mix of mod and traditional (both concrete and hardwood floors, penny & subway tiles) with loads of windows. Very comfortable beds, strong water pressure, quiet (although if you're sensitive to traffic noise, opt for the downstairs room). The upstairs room has a walk-out terrace. Both rooms have walk-in closets, full baths, plenty of linens, and toiletries. We didn't have time to enjoy the outdoor grill and large private table and chairs but we really appreciated the abundant and varied coffee--much needed during our very busy weekend. There is an open landing on the second floor with a day bed with pull-out bed. The location and layout met our needs perfectly. Thank you.

Reviewer Comments:

We stayed for two weeks while our daughter got settled at UT Austin and it worked well for us. We didn't have a car (although the parking was very good) and the location was great as we could easily walk pretty much everywhere - 6th St, 2nd St, Rainey St, Congress Bridge for the bats etc. 6 minutes' walk to Republic Square put us on the Metro bus routes which we used for SoCo, UT campus, Barton Springs, HEB etc. The apartment itself was comfortable for 2 people. The loft bedroom was fine for 2 more people but obviously had to navigate the spiral staircase for the bathroom etc. Our only minor complaints were the constant drone of the multiple air-con units situated on the roof of the property, and the lack of saucepans in the kitchen - quite challenging to make full use of the 4-hob range with just 1 frying pan! Other than that, the apartment was well equipped. Communication with TurnKey was a little tricky as their text system didn't recognise international cell numbers, but phone calls worked OK. The cleaner was still there when we checked in, but we were able to have a later check-out at the end of our stay, so that sort of cancelled out. All in all, a good place to stay in downtown Austin.

The location of this property is wonderful for wandering around downtown. We had a 4 year old and had planned on swimming while we were there. Unfortunately, the pool is located across the street on a sister property which is not at all handy.

The refrigerator was not cooling properly but we managed. I would certainly stay there again for an adult weekend.

Setup to be a 3 bedroom with kitchen. This place is perfect if you literally just need a place to crash and plan on being out in Austin all day/evening. The couch and chair in the living room isn't ideal if you want to hang around the house all day, especially if you have more than 2 people or 2 couples. TurnKey was a little annoying. I had to call them twice, first to complete the booking, second to get the house code.

We were in for our daughters babyshower, and were six staying in the house. It was absolutely perfect for our stay, spotless inside when we arrived and well appointed with all we needed. Negatives ~ Internet was down and it took a repair guy on day 2 to fix a wire. Two of us had to go and work from Starbucks. The access code was changed for no reason on day 3, we couldn't get in and many calls before rectified. This was horrible as we were late for the shower. Outside needs to be maintained ~ a sad Christmas decoration, a soggy phone book, weeds & debris were the opposite of the beautiful interior.

Unfortunately, with being next to a large restaurant, the noise from the trash truck emptying the dumpster everyday at 6am woke us all up. I would suggest putting blinds on the bedroom windows. It gets rather bright rather early in the mornings. The beds are very comfortable. Adding a bluetooth speaker for music would be a nice add. I couldn't get the TV to change channels. I did not call about it because it wasn't that important to us, but it might need to be looked at. It's stuck on Bravo. Having said all that, it's still a great place that is convenient to SoCo.

We unfortunately had our Homeaway cancel 7 days before arriving in Austin due to plumbing issues. Homeaway had an incredible travel support team help me locate a new property that was within a similar price range and the same neighborhood as before. In a matter of 24 hours, we were able to rebook this awesome home in Bouldin Creek. The property was absolutely beautiful, and incredibly clean. The three bedrooms provided ample space for 5 of us, and the large kitchen was perfect for entertaining. We had a little trouble with the WiFi and someone from Turnkey was at the house in 15 minutes to fix it! The neighborhood was also a huge win! We were across the street from the delicious Polvos mexican restaurant, and walking distance from Dolce Neve (amazing ice cream), some food trucks, and Once Over Coffee Bar, which came in handy both mornings! I would highly recommend this property, and hope I can stay here again for my next Austin outing! My only recommendation would be to add a full length mirror to the downstairs master bedroom! :)

We did have a downstairs shower issue but it was fixed within hours by the handyman. We enjoyed the area down by the river/lake and the tram ride down. Warning, the water is VERY cold but refreshing.

The house is two stories with the Master Bedroom tucked away upstairs with its beautiful private patio. The Main floor has two addition bedrooms, dining room, living room, laundry room and bathroom. Nestled on a cliff, the hot tub on the patio offered great views of the valley below. Jennifer did a wonderful job decorating the house with each door a reclaimed piece of art. Hand rails, tile, sinks were all thoughtfully planned out with no expense spared. There is a tram that runs from the house down below to the lakeside where there is a private boathouse and patio area. The tram itself is a marvel of engineering, self leveling and fun. Kayaks and paddle boards completed the well thought out paradise. The only complaint? The water was a bit chilly but I imagine that it would be perfect in August.

The views from the house are spectacular and the lake, as experienced from the boathouse and terrace, is beautiful. When we were there the tram connecting the two was under landing repairs so we were unable to utilize that convenience; no worries, there is a road that conveniently connects the two. The three story deck at the house (with hot tub) was awesome.

The interior of the house is clean, well laid out, and recently redecorated. All in all, a great interior experience. We felt comfortable and relaxed. The house was very well equipped; we have rented many houses over the years and this kitchen was the best. My favorite experience is the view from the Master Bedroom in the morning; the sun comes peeking through the oak trees that shelter the house and decks. It feels like you can see forever.

The completely fenced yard was a boon for our dogs. They were able to be outside without us worrying about their safety.

We jumped in the tram right outside our backdoor and rode down to the waterfront property located on Lake austin. We spent several days on lake Austin, paddle boarding, swimming and boating. The house is conveniently located to Lake Travis as well, we spent several days on that lake. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook if we wanted a quite Evening in after a day on the water or we could take a short car trip into downtown Austin to enjoy what the city had to offer such as Shopping/ dining on South Congress, live music in the warehouse district/6th street or laying out in Zilker Park. We even did some day trips to Schlitterbahn and Hamilton Pools. Beautiful views from the house and shower overlooking the lake and dam, watched the sunrise from my bed in the master bedroom.

We enjoyed the location, spaciousness and amenities in this home. We concur with other reviewers that suggest curtains should be installed in at least two of the bedrooms. The shades that are there do not provide privacy or darken the room enough. We also would have like to have had at least one additional chair in the living area. We would stay here again for sure but these couple of changes would make it perfect.

Loved this place! Super great location and everything was just like the pictures. Definitely a rental, not outfitted for long-term stays (no soap, no spices, etc). One tip for rental company is to get a blind for the main door (it's a huge window), because the thermostat is right in the path of the sunlight and it reads the whole apartment as hot, when it's really very chilly and probably expensive as a property owner.

Rented this house for a weekend getaway with some college friends. Overall this property was fantastic. Good layout, clean, and overall decently stocked. It was lacking some towels, missing a toaster and a broom/Swiffer so we could tidy up to avoid insects, which only became a concern when we spotted a cockroach. Called the management company on these items and they did offer to send out housekeeping. It's in a great location. Nice walk to South Congress and short Uber rides to downtown, Rainey and Sixth Street. Would recommend this property.

It is a great location in terms of walking, there is off street parking, and the community is residential, so you feel like you are at home. The house has key less entry, which was a bit tricky at first, but overall, this was a success.

We stayed in town for the Austin Marathon and absolutely loved the location. The house itself was clean, comfortable, and beautifully furnished. We will definitely be staying here again! A couple tips, there isn't a ton of kitchen supplies (we couldn't find a cutting board or aluminum foil/plastic wrap), but with so many amazing restaurants nearby, it wasn't too much of a problem for us. Also, the master bedroom's curtains aren't terribly efficient. We noticed that it was still somewhat visible from the outside. But we just made sure we kept the master bathroom door closed when showering and were fully clothed when walking around. :)

The house was very nice and in a great location. However, you can see directly into the house, in detail, from the back of this house-which is a well used alley. As a group of women we did not feel safe AT ALL. Especially after the motion sensor on the side of the house went off at 3am and the next morning a cigarette butt was found next to the main door and large footprints along the side of the house made it aware someone not in our group was lurking around the house. Please put up curtains in the bedroom! Also, the smoke alarm in the bedroom was missing. We had a cockroach walk across the kitchen into the laundry closet. Three easy and cheap fixes would have made this stay much better. Put up curtains in the back bedroom! Replace the smoke detector and hire pest control. It also wouldn’t be expensive to have kitchen staples in the house, we could have used a cutting board during our stay but there wasn’t one!

It was a great location. Right next to La Mexicana for amazing breakfast tacos and right next to Churro Co. for amazing snacks. Polvos was also right across the street for great happy hour. Walking distance to SoCo and all the parks and downtown. Can't recommend it highly enough! Lots of space and very comfortable. The coffee maker didn't work when we got there, but they fixed it right away. Suggestions: 1) Have at least a couple of pods of coffee when we arrive as it was rough that first day lol; 2) Put some more chairs for outside as the little bistro set is nice, but only seats 2; 3) BLACKOUT SHADES for the master bedroom. The last one is really the most important. It wasn't an issue for us as we had a toddler who wakes up at 6am so we beat the sun everyday, but definitely not going to be sleeping in once that sun comes out. It really was a great stay and can't wait to get back again! The parking in the back was really clutch as street parking got full sometimes.

Location location location! Can’t say enough how great the location of this place is. Literally walking distance to great shopping, restaurants and brunch spots. House is really nice, seemed to be brand new or close to it. Great open kitchen and living area. My one critique would be the window coverings, you can see right into the house at night and for a group of women we felt a little uneasy about that esp those of us sleeping on the first level. Also, the key pad was very difficult to use and we were unable to get the door to even lock at the end. Seemed to be a mchanical issue. We called turnkey and they at first it was a bit of an issue bc the person we talked to didn’t quite know what to do. An additional person called me and we were able to discuss the issue and he said he would handle it. He seemed to know a lot more than the first person we talked to. We had a great time and would 100% rent this house again.

461,https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p1158791vb#reviews,"Sep 24, 2018",1/5,Cockroaches. Every. Night. Do I have your attention?,"Before our stay the owners of this rental emailed us a very detailed house manual that included this statement: “One of the most important lessons that we have learned from the experience is managing expectations. Below, we will explain what we expect from you, and what you can expect from us.” It’s clear after our stay at this property that there is absolutely no concern or care for the renters’ experience or expectations. I can sadly say that staying at this house was the only bad experience during our trip to the funky (yet refined) city of Austin.

Amid several strict house rules in this house manual, including the guests having to pay for a plumber out of pocket if there is a clog in the house’s shoddy plumbing due to flushing normal amounts of toilet paper, there was no mention of expecting cockroaches even though they became a staple of our stay in the owner’s “home”. When we emailed the owners about our problem they responded asking if anyone had left the door open, which we did not. By that logic, if all of the cockroaches we saw came in through an open door then the handful of strategically placed roach traps throughout the entire house and the can of Raid roach spray that was in the cabinet under the sink must have, too.

When we get down to it, the problem wasn’t the cockroaches. We did some research and apparently roaches can be expected in certain parts of Austin, especially the older parts of the city, because nature. You can’t change that. But what one can change is their response to a person who is asking for your help and prioritizing their renters’ needs. Based on the miscommunication, avoidance, and general deference of responsibility we received from the owners it became clear that the only expectations being set were if we didn’t like what we received, including eight people performing nightly room and bed checks for cockroaches, then we could pack up and go. That's the kind of care and service we received during our stay and is why I can't recommend giving the owners of this property a single cent.

As I’m thinking about those fond memories I remember that at any moment a cockroach could have come skittering across my pillow and I am firmly brought back to reality. Do yourself a favor and find another place to stay.
